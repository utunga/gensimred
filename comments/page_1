as long time member of aa i'm glad to see this ruling don't believe in god but there's ton of god bs in aa and don't believe the government should be forcing people to attend meetings where there is so much god stuff don't think it has amounted to slavery though and don't think inouye should get anything other than this ruling

starting and stopping any of these drugs is always dangerous the sad thing think here is that there is conversation to be had about how some of these drugs while helping many also have tendency to bring out violence in some individuals and that's legitimate conversation that gets derailed by scientology's hatred of all psychiatric medication
the dumbest and most sensationalist stories on the front page today are people complaining reddit sucks
think it's kind of funny the article talks about how whether 250 gb is reasonable isn't really the point the dangers of charging for over-use is and then most of you sit there debating whether 250 gb is reasonable

when was in the 10 th grade one kid in class had an epileptic seizure and physically attacked the teacher it took three pe teachers to restrain him we're not talking about laying on the ground and shaking the student came back week or two later to apologize to the teacher in front of the class before leaving the school i'm rarely surprised when hear of cops abusing their stun guns but if this kid was as violent as the kid knew in high school--and if he hit fireman in the face don't think stunning him was an overreaction

this is like people complaining about their car payment when the price of gas goes up
per gallon yes but they'd be paying more than if they bought less
their unit cost has risen if their total cost went up it's because they didn't pay enough to cover operating expenses the previous year they're complaining because they don't understand the economics of their bill

love the quote from the discovery institute think tank they crafted the term intelligent design and the exaflood for client pr campaigns the former being for evangelicals looking to push creationism into the classroom the latter being term used to justify telecom industry move toward metered billing and overage charges by pretending bandwidth is running out those who wish to debate economic policy on the basis of facts rather than opinion will find this book indispensable richard w. rahn chairman of novecon financial and senior fellow at the discovery institute

really didn't like the people on either side of this debate one side was an over-emotional and sometimes downright psychotic contingent of parents or autistic individuals completely willing to ignore science because of fear the other side was an obnoxious flurry of self-righteous pseudo-intellectuals and so-called professional skeptics drunk with the infallibility of supposed modern medicine while screaming insults at many parents who just wanted more real data

work with tons of vietnamese and while we may have killed two million of them for no good reason i've never encountered any animosity towards the us for that stupid war on the part of any vietnamese and have asked few of them culturally holding grudges doesn't seem to be their way
clearly british
however it also seems pretty reasonable to accept these invitations in hopes of convincing people that evolution has occurred absolutely not intelligent design is not science it's creationism with coat of paint and the discovery institute is not an intellectual or scientific organization it's public relations firm they should be told squarely in no uncertain terms to go fuck themselves unless you want magic in your cheerios

um so you're against the death penalty too right cuz you know the catholic church is against the death penalty you are consistent aren't you like all good catholics
my apologies i'm born/raised catholic and know many many who are against abortion because the church says so but they are for the death penalty--even though the church is against it i'd disagree with you on abortion but laud your consistency

guess the catholic church could have ignored the case--it wasn't necessary that they take this opportunity to preach about the rights of the unborn you seem to believe that by ignoring the case the church would be preaching that murder was okay it's not or b. also jumping to the conclusion that ignoring the case is tantamount to preaching that murder is okay is assuming that there is agreement that terminating pregnancy is murder this is not accepted by all parties your jumping to this conclusion leads one me to believe that you believe abortion is murder--a position don't agree with
whether your expressing your own views or that of the church's it's not applicable this is case of accepting the lesser of two evils the girl could die along with the twins or the pregnancy could be terminated you and the church may feel that it's intolerable and equivalent to slavery or whatever but plenty of people can see that saving the girl's life is worthwhile pursuit excommunicating the family and the doctors is just stupid

peta may have problems but if you're upvoting story from an artificial corporate-funded consumer advocate blog to the front page of reddit so do you
i'm curious how many redditors understand that corporations now use completely bogus consumer advocacy groups judging from how often see disinformation/astroturf articles on the front page not enough
you're not going to get the real data from lobbyist/pr firm that works for the corporations peta targets
the people are corporations using euthanasia records newsflash people don't adopt adult cats and dogs many of whom have behavioral problems and were dumped on peta as the last in line of adoption attempts as public relations attack
judge the data not the messenger judge both
the facts have already been colored by the messenger unwanted pets read abused animals that now shit and piss everywhere and/or bite their owners are euthanized by the millions everywhere all the time this is not shocking unless you live in cartoon corporation presenting it as shocking through bogus consumer advocacy firm as part of broad effort to silence peta is somewhat important to consider as part of the broader conclusion unless you would like to avoid being rational and logical and take data presented to you by corporate lobbyist to draw your conclusions without parsing all the data first national shelter averages the animal rights records of the corporate sponsor of this hit piece petas explanation of the numbers the understanding that peta is running end of the line humane euthanasia service not an adoption service etc
spend lot of my time writing about these kind of disinformation efforts and modern propaganda in general fascinates me
oh get that don't debate that peta is hypocrite and has some idiotic tactics just pointing out that people's dislike of peta is being manipulated here by lobbying operation that targets all activism groups and think people need to be aware of it the idea that end-of-the-line pets that get dumped on peta by other adoption agencies get euthanized is not particularly shocking really
believe in yes and no
sheer amusement
like most of these metered broadband pushes users should be able to log into the website to see their usage and how close they are to the cap
also keep in mind that this is still trial and they're proceeding based on user feedback if you're in time warner cable market calling or writing them to complain may actually help
be careful though frontier has talked about imposing 5gb per month cap on all of its tiers and currently they can barely offer more than 3mbps speeds in many markets
you're exactly right bandwidth and hardware costs are decreasing this is about monetizing and/or deterring the use of internet video which of course is long term threat to their tv revenues yes caps impact only the heaviest users now but by imposing them now before internet video really takes off they can avoid becoming the dumb pipe
we need viable model to be able to support the infrastructure of the broadband business that suggests that flat-rate pricing combined with other revenue sources like dns redirection advertising is not viable model can you perhaps show me where time warner cable ever operated at loss or even anything less than very healthy profits under the flat-rate pricing model
probably not and imagine that the trial is really being used to perfect the marketing message as to why this kind of money grab is necessary but keep in mind time warner cable so far isn't testing this in markets where there's an uncapped competitor so there is still hope raising stink with them may still help if you tell them you'll be leaving to competitors even if you don't have one lie
time travel explains this somehow the statistical measurement was taken in the future after we all clicked on prison planet to see what the fuck they were talking about
perhaps one reason for the abysmal recovery rate is because the courts send so many people who don't want to stop drinking know many in aa myself included who wish the courts would not send people believe it's violation of one's rights to be sent to religious program that said i'm an athiest as are many many of my friends who are long-term sober and members of aa it's not bible-thumping environment generally and depending on where you go you can find groups full of agnostics and non-believers though not whole lot there's definitely lot of bunk in the steps but it's not all bunk making amends for past indiscretions can genuinely help people to mend their damaged relationships there's plenty of bs but it's not all bad in the end while i'd fix bunch of stuff in aa still think it's better to have it available to those who want to go than to get rid of it
i've read all the orange-papers interesting stuff as recall and some unsubstantiated rumor and over-generalization as well believe it has value as counterpoint to the bs in aa and the hero-worship bill receives here and there as cult taking over peoples lives it's not very effective there is no leader there's no money to be made the general downside for those who don't like it is the time wasted listening to psychobabble always liked that word and studying bs theory written by long-dead snake-oil salesman then again many many people don't have anything better to do with their time other than get loaded so hanging around aa even for what you list as bad reason is still good thing for some to me it's place to go and see friends and get reminded of the mess made of my life and some of the psychological tricks i've learned over time to distract myself from negative thinking or whatever you want to call it wrong thinking is punished--right thinking is as quickly rewarded prefect the menagerie
i'm not sure why you're being downvoted though i'd say the reason aa doesn't do science is because it's more like religion and relies on dogma not on research aa is not medical though i'm sure there are people in aa who think what they have is better than medicine
while aa doesn't claim to be religion it pretty much fits the bill in that it is generally centered around purporting belief in god whatever you call it there are courts who see it as religion don't go saying i'm part of religion but have hard time arguing that aa is not religion i'll argue that it's not cult--though it might have been at one time
the picture needs circle of pale white middle class over-privileged twenty and thirty somethings surrounding chewbacca sitting in orange plastic chairs with their pot bellies gleaming in the sunlight and their thumbs up or down in affirmation and rejection and more lasers
an interesting read given the substitution but the comparison doesn't hold up how many people do you know who are scientologists know zero--i believe because scientologists keep to themselves if scientology is on the cult scale let's put the peoples temple at 10 then aa is
don't see many people quoting the bible in meetings though sure there are plenty of christians in meetings
love the amway comparison call it trolling for newcomers remember reading somewhere study probably bs but who knows the purported that being sponsor was better for you than having sponsor ego supposed to get rid of it or feed it
is that reverence or adoration your attributing here
guess the reason bothered to engage with the question is because believe in no god yet on occassion will pray if only to quiet the mind will recite the serenity prayer to nobody playing psychological trick on myself which probably works less and less as time goes by hence given your response still view no evidence of required worship in aa nor worship on my own part though may occassionally engage in ritual for ritual's sake
there is nothing to see here coordinated efforts at disinformation do not exist please return to your hot pockets and dancing with the stars
no don't ban scientology but absolutely take away their tax exempt status given they're for profit company

bonding not my area but know the municipality work for does 30 year bonds for capital improvement not saying it's great idea but if they could prevent 3m/year in losses then it might be depending on the numbers

its slow but relatively recent development the idea comes from good place book for example can have built-in audience so if they can make book into movie they can make comic if they can make comic they can make toy or brand into movie through recognition so why not stop at remaking movies its recognized brand name with built in audience and from the studio/producer's standpoint they already have the rights to the material so its no-brainer personally can't stand it but there's no way to fight then trend from within it will take audiences not going to the star trek movie to stop hollywood from making a-team the movie
having worked for the company that made those amazing decisions can say it comes specifically from the higher brass not recognizing newer methods of gauging show's audience its frustrating and unfortunately its just the way hollywood works they need to see results maybe not after the first season but unless show can prove that the audience is growing its just easier to hedge their bets cancel the show and try the next thing i'll give you the short version its presenting viable business model to the content creators its one thing to watch show its another to pay revenue for it initially the logic behind hulu would be as place to get people interested in the show so that they would watch it through traditional methods there's no doubt that people are watching shows in new different ways permanently but until standards for how that material is paid for are established across the board then no major network/studio is going to get behind it that's rarely the case the general process for show is that single person or team create an idea that they sell to network now if the creator has experience as showrunner the day to day producing of the show if not they'll team the creators with seasoned showrunner they'll create the pilot and if the pilot gets picked up then they'll hire team of writers to do the bulk of the work ultimately the creator and showrunner have final say on each episode and most often will do the final punch up on each episode things can get green-lit before there's pilot based on an outstanding deal for example someone of joss whedon's caliber will create something amazing so the network or studio would have blind deal with them where they essentially agree to make whatever idea that creator comes up with its very rare most times the network or studio execs will take look at the pilot script consider the talent behind it and see if it makes sense to give it shot hope this gives you some answers feel free to ask away
out of college the money wasn't so bad but the hours were killer worked at talent agency for long time and i'd have 12 hour days but the truth is that it was 24 hour days because i'd wake up go to work work 12 hours come home eat and go to sleep so can wake up hours later and do it again personally love movies can't see myself doing anything else with my life besides this maybe later in life the money will be an issue but for now look at everything like an opportunity to learn but beyond actually learning how the job is done i've also met people who will be part of my career for the rest of my life there's very few other industries that are like that i'd love to work as tv writer like the freedom of working as creative individual but like the structured environment of the writer's room but my experience on whole has been producing features so more than likely i'll be working for this producer until can find job as junior executive somewhere else or get promoted here
came to school in los angeles and every semester interned at different place eventually interning for talent agency when graduated ended up working as an assistant to an agent and that's pretty much graduate school for hollywood its crash course in everything from learning the business to dealing with crazy personalities and long contracts after that transitioned to job working for producer and then another each time taking on more and more responsibilities can tell you right now if you're interested the first thing you need to do is humble yourself you'll take lot of shit work long hours for little pay at the chance to maybe find good job somewhere where you'll get the chance to develop your own projects and leverage your company's name to get something sold
ha actually the sad truth is that its lot like entourage except where nothing works out the way its supposed to there are essentially two types of producers line producers and creative producers line producers are below the line that means they are considered part of the crew not talent they get paid relatively small amount but do the day to day producing of hiring crew and finding locations creative producers are above the line they're in the same category as directors and actors and usually make millions per project they usually are the ones that find the scripts attach the directors and sell it to the studio they then hire line producer to do the workhorse stuff there are wide range of producers i've worked for someone who would just sell the project and then sit on their butt during production and collect checks i've worked for producers who are on set everyday and deal with every detail of getting the movie made from securing locations to making sure the talent has the salad they wanted

guarantee you if you have really great idea and you write it out into well designed script someone will make it don't think of it like you're competing against these remakes the truth is lot of remakes use the title or name of an old movie on top of new script the trickier part is getting your work out to the right people the system is designed so that its extremely difficult for people outside of the system to get their script looked at producers won't look at script unless it was sent from an agent or manager an agent won't look at script unless its sent by manager or producer manager only wants to sign people who have sold their script to producer or who have an agent but not manager but there are ways in usually it just involved getting into the industry itself and finding someone who will take the time to look at your script despite not having representation
have seen ari emanuel couple times but have never formally met him he's not nearly as zany as jeremy piven portrays him lot of the ridiculousness that happens in the industry is when people with crazy personalities are given licence to act crazy to their assistant and the people around them simply because they're good at their job have plenty of stories but most of them are only funny because of the big name people involved and for the sake of having none of this come back to me i'll have to be vague on the specific names but worked for producer who was banned from the set of his own movie for making the actors feel uncomfortable there is certain producer in town who has term in his deal with studio that assures his dog will be in every movie he makes with them really good read if you subscribe to the wall street journal is this one about scott rudin http://online.wsj.com/article/0 sb112749746571150033 00 html mod home_page_one_us it'll really give you an idea of the shit assistants put up with
much more likely that they'll do sequel to the film serenity less of long term commitment on everyone's part but joss whedon is pretty busy with the day to day of dollhouse so basically if you want serenity to happen you'll have to stop watching dollhouse and hope that joss isn't feeling creative enough to come up with new idea or to work on goner or cabin in the woods
creative but hands on producer so both although have people working below me who deal with the fun on-set stuff so part of my job is reading the myriad of scripts that come in to see if any are worth pursuing for the company
haha well i'd hate to say it but with fans like you whedon doesn't need enemies at the network actually truth be told its those execs who get behind the idea that get the show started to begin with they're more often then not an equal creative force in show's development process that i'm sure they're just as dissappointed when they have to cancel shows and start over
jon heder the fact that he has career is complete testament to the hard work of jared hess director of napoleon dynamite and heder's agent dave bugliari at caa and that's usually what it is someone being at the right place at the right time and being used as conduit for other people's projects and labor yeap not really if anything you're more impressed by the amount of work that goes into creating something that tugs at an audiences emotion as kid had to leave the theater because ernest scared stupid film from 1991 scared me so much but that experience sparked desire to learn how people create monsters and tension in movies so even though its terrible movie should thank it for making me want to make movies yeah mean couple things strike me if you've ever visited la you'll know that every bar and every restaurant is teeming with good looking but desperate people just wanting to make it as soon as they hear or think you might be in position to help them they quickly become the best waiter/bartender ever but the funniest story can think of is again at the agency agencies like most other hollywood companies are pretty tight as far as security is concerned the particular place worked at you had to swipe card to get in pass two security welcome desks swipe card at the elevator and then know what floor you were going to this one time an unusual woman was wandering our floor and had found her way to one of the biggest talent agent's offices the agent's assistant asked the woman if she was the masseuse the assistant being new believed her and let her through sure enough the woman was desperate to get her foot in the door and had walked in with her headshot actor's picture and resume and presented herself as the next big thing unfortunately for her that particular agent was psychopath so the agent promptly had security throw her out and of course the assistant was fired within the hour as well so that assistant can thank that aspiring actress amazing idea to break in for the reason they're unemployed
casting is actually pretty slow boring process and lot of casting is done below the radar but by and large the majority of casting directors are older women and gay men so think the traditional notion of what happens on casting couch isn't exactly true although can say that desperate actresses will do anything to get good representation and some of the old hollywood players like to indulge their misguided sense of success
nope there's pretty specific difference between the titles and while i'm sure to someone outside of the industry the thought of being someone's executive assistant for years on end doesn't sound like the ideal way to pursue career however in hollywood that's how its done every single person i've worked for has at some point been someone else's assistant its how you learn the day to day of the job and it also creates those interpersonal relationships that are the basis of job in the industry think i'm good at my job but its certainly not what i'm in for want to be the person who creates the story that takes people on an adventure outside of their normal lives really can't think of any other industry where can do that and get paid for it too
inevitably if you want to work in films you'll have to come to los angeles its sad fact but every single company in town hires free labor we just call them interns but its great way in the door to figure out what you want to do it's more difficult to land an internship at the bigger places the studios/networks but there are literally thousands of smaller management or production companies that hire people every semester if you're interested i'd recommend looking for the uta joblist its an email list that goes out every week listing the available jobs and internships i'd also recommend http://www.entertainmentcareers.net other major cities to pursue entertainment jobs mostly because of productions there for tax incentives new york chicago atlanta vancouver and london
sadly no but oddly enough they provide full coverage for damage caused by lame insults
sadly have not read either of these books the trick is that if you capture the culture of hollywood at any given time you'll find its drastically different from the one that preceded it can't even imagine how this business functioned before blackberrys email or the internet but i've heard of enough stories from people who survived more hectic times in the industry to know that things are relatively tame and outsiders making it in the industry is less and less of reality actors are truely the worst compared to everyone else on the set they work the least amount of hours get the highest pay and have every comfort imaginable so its always unnerving to see them complain and blow up on set only because they're told its okay to do if grip complained he had headache he'd be fired and that would be the end of it interned for temporarily unsuccessful manager who couldn't afford car insurance so he had me drive him to his meetings one of which was on the disney lot however he told me to stay in the parking lot until the meeting got out...it was and half our meeting i've worked mostly with writers and think it would astonish you to know how many mid-level no name writers have really come up with brilliant things that will never see the light of day due to bullshit factors there are too many to count but i'd say jason weiner is one of them
for production i'd stick with mandy.com its your best bet i'm sure you know this since you've gone through school but the best way to do is get pa or 2nd ac jobs on local productions impress the hell out of the dp and stick with them from project to project don't know the market that well in new york but isn't the joke that everyone in there works on law and order at some point in their lives
quotes are the business of talent agents for any amount they get paid by studio other studios and sometimes third party financiers have to consider previous sums paid for older projects so the longer an actor has been working the more likely it is that his quote is absurd granted people can and do reduce their quotes but my guess is he gets enough work to make drastic reduction in his price kind of pointless but i'm just speculating
not in million years but if it does happen my guess is reddit will know about it before do
assistant to producer assistant producer is title given on project basis for someone's involvement in the process often writers or studio executives who contributed to the project will be give an ap credit as form of acknowledgement producing credits mostly applies to features tv is different producer creative producer exec producer studio exec or producer in name only line producer btl proder co-producer similar to associate producer but with more authority and often hire compensation associate producer
lloyd works for the head agent of his own company its safe to say many assistants aspire to be lloyd although he's been ari's assistant for way too long in the real world he'd be coordinator junior agent or fired by now
bingo that movie is about as close as you can get in fact little too close
its not unusual for production staff and writers to show up in scene or two for show they work for the office is one of those few exceptions where lot of the initial writers were also actors and the show was small enough that their cameos became more pronounced and showed off their acting chops bj novak in particular but its pretty rare...snl is probably the closest thing can think of
everyone literally everyone at some point in their career will be either typecast or hurt by their reputation eventually the desperation for money will come along and viola vin diesel the thing that you have to keep in mind is that for the most part all movies start out with good script or fun idea but its somewhere in the process that it becomes bad movie bad direction budget constraints poor casting so keep that in mind when vin diesel ruins wheelman
defer to david cross on all things desperate actor/la sucks http://underthedog.com/tunes/live/david 20 cross-la 20 zona 20 rosa_austin 20 tx_5-23-2002/06-la.mp3
there's lot of bullshit to it ultimately it comes down to one or two people's opinion on whether show stays on or not they'll refer to nielson ratings ect and execs will make their case but its very finicky way to decide the fate of show it feels more like there should be board of directors deciding
many times by other people but never told i'll never work in this town again so guess that's good have seen an assistant pegged in the head with stapler before he's definitely not worked since
again i'm speculating but tv work specifically cameos are great for actors who just need little cash most shows shoot in la they only need them for short time and they get paid well also the trend in hollywood lately has been to attach big directors or producers with no name actors making up the price difference so big name actor can still use it for little boost with television as for why gary sinese is on csi ny...no idea probably favor and probably hard to find consistent work in new york just guess
its not easy there's always going to be assistant gigs opening up but with the economy the way it is you're going up against people who have years of work behind them and are willing to do it for less then they would have only few years ago the general advice is to come to la get job in the mailroom of talent agency work desk as an assistant and transition into what you want to do just know from firsthand experience the market sucks and its tough to get in right now i'm from california but had never been to la until came out here for college that definitely helped had three years more experience then people who came from boston or chicago but people in their late 20 come from grad school and end up interning at the same place did its just matter of proving who wants it more and majority of the people who work in the industry are transplants in fact off the top of my head can only think of two people who are originally from la think that if you grow up here unless you're literally born into it you kind of resent the industry so its the bright-eyed bushy tailed kids from the midwest who end up becoming the big players
think they clearly have with shows coming back after being cancelled but you can't justify new show based on the theoretical dvd sales so its tough decision think the slow trend will be to wait to see how dvds perform but i'm willing to bet that they already have direct correlation to nielson ratings so it might all be moot point baby boomer families in the midwest not hating just using as an example who have set hours for watching their nightly programs who grew up with it and still even watch the commercials for their favorite drama or procedural still outweigh diehard fans of innovative content no matter how many dvds and bit of merchandise they buy and thus they dictate the market
boss-zilla by kate kelly and merissa marr september 24 2005 page a1 on his way out of the office for childhood friend's funeral last year 27 year-old jon silk scrambled to handle one final task for his boss movie producer scott rudin mr silk presented an elaborate chart laying out mr rudin's options for attending theater productions during coming trip to london what happened next helps explain why mr rudin holds the unofficial crown of hollywood's most feared boss unable to make sense of the chart the producer of films such as the truman show and the hours went nuclear on his grieving assistant learn to communicate he screamed hurling stack of papers across the room and telling him to get out when mr silk slammed the door behind him mr rudin canned the assistant and demanded he surrender his cellphone and identification badge think you're really fired another assistant mouthed in hushed tone to mr silk the outburst would be the stuff of legend in almost any workplace but in mr rudin's office caustic rants shrieking threats and impulsive firings are routine mr rudin hires the young and ambitious who flock to the movie industry testing their mettle in an intense environment when they can't meet his exacting standards from translating obscure french art journals to tracking vacationing directors in the himalayas he is quick to hit the eject button the result is revolving door that never stops spinning the precise number of assistants who have worked for mr rudin in the past five years is hard to pin down but some assistants peg it at 250 or more mr rudin says his insurance records show he has had 119 assistants over that period but those records don't include assistants who were fired during two-week trial period all parties agree that the tenures can be short and tumultuous by his own account mr rudin once ordered an assistant out of rental car for being late telling him you're fired get out take taxi wherever you're going he says he fired legally blind assistant more than once not because he was blind but because he wasn't good enough at the job then rehired him because he felt guilty seeing the man standing at the bus stop outside his window another former assistant says he was dismissed for bringing the wrong breakfast muffin mr rudin doesn't recall that but says it is entirely possible mr rudin acknowledges there is hard-scrabble environment in his offices in new york and los angeles the thin-skinned guys don't like it says the 47 year-old producer the thick-skinned people...understand that i'm working as hard as them he describes his management style as cross between attila the hun and miss jean brodie in hollywood where assistants do everything from answering the phone to buying birthday presents and dropping the kids off at summer camp working for mr rudin is coveted position the pay is exceptionally good ranging from 75,000 to 150,000 and staffers sometimes get to rub elbows with a-list talent those who survive often land plum jobs later it has become modern equivalent of the william morris agency's mailroom or gig as page at the nbc studios proving ground for would-be moguls hyped on caffeine and eager to please the assistants compromise their health self-esteem and personal lives in an attempt to break into one of the world's most darwinian businesses tough bosses are rite of passage in any career generations of parents counsel their children that the most demanding boss may also be the one who teaches them the most preparing them for the rigors of the workplace among the lessons learned at the feet of mr rudin fear is great motivator says derek evans former assistant now senior executive at spyglass entertainment faced with mr rudin's attacks assistants can either go running for the next bus home or suck it up and stick it out after his own humiliation mr silk chose the latter when mr rudin cooled down couple of days later mr silk who took ulcer medication during his employment there accepted an offer to try again definitely wanted to go back he says my plan was that if could make it six months would have my pick of jobs mr rudin says he doesn't recall the details of firing and rehiring mr silk but says he is crazy about mr silk and was happy to recommend him for other jobs mr silk is now creative executive for gold circle films which produced my big fat greek wedding indeed the movie business is populated with successful rudin proteges including dreamworks skg production head adam goodman and craig perry producer of the american pie movies it's an unspoken quid pro quo the assistant dukes it out for six months or year and mr rudin opens doors afterward attribute an enormous amount of whatever success i've been able to attain directly because of how saw him operate says mr perry does he yell sure do yell sure typically in their early 20 the assistants most of whom are men usually come directly from college some hail from top-tier institutions including duke johns hopkins and harvard but mr rudin isn't impressed by fancy degrees the more money they grow up with the better the school the quicker they wash out he says some assistants have year or two of experience at production companies in new york or l.a. but these days most are referred through an informal network of rudin alumni says one former staffer you get call from another assistant on friday afternoon saying hey rudin just fired another assistant can you start monday most crucial is an ability to take heat from day one when mr evans was an l.a. based assistant in 1995 he recalls reviewing list of important calls with mr rudin over the phone and mispronouncing director alan pakula's last name he said pack-yoo-lah instead of the correct pah-cool-ah hearing the error mr rudin went crazy on me says mr evans the producer fired him immediately telling him to get out of the office off the lot leave hollywood los angeles and california getting louder each time says mr evans he fled to the paramount pictures commissary where he cooled his heels for six hours before getting the beeper message 911 from another assistant which meant to return to the office 411 message meant to call after being rehired as many staffers are mr evans added pronunciation details to stack of 500 flashcards he had already made with names and phone numbers of important rudin contacts had to go back and make sure wrote down phonetically the difficult ones he says mr rudin says the flashcards were his idea you can't sound like you don't have clue who you're calling he says he told mr evans native of baldwin n.y. on long island mr rudin didn't attend college instead learning the industry under his own set of taskmasters he worked for the late movie and tv producer edgar scherick who mr rudin says often complained he was surrounded by mediocrity as teen in the 1970 mr rudin worked for broadway producers including the late kermit bloomgarden producer of death of salesman who instructed him to pick tomato bugs off plants on his apartment terrace mr rudin says he was sometimes required to haul mr bloomgarden's false leg to harlem for repairs on the bus since the producer wouldn't spring for cab fare whatever i've asked anybody to do i've never removed any of my limbs mr rudin says in business where rising costs and corporate consolidation have squeezed out many independent producers mr rudin puts out as many as eight pictures year last year his films varied from family fare like lemony snicket's series of unfortunate events to the sex drama closer and remake of the manchurian candidate at the moment he has roughly 50 movies in development including adaptations of the novel the corrections the pulitzer prize-winning the amazing adventures of kavalier amp clay and film about three mississippi boys who embarked on shot-by-shot remake of raiders of the lost ark in the 1980
in rudin productions new york office near times square his time is surgically managed by five assistants who are classified by duty the executive assistant or no in rudin shorthand manages the schedule and travels with the boss that position the highest-paid is now held by 22 year-old the second-ranking assistant occupies the hot seat manning phones and helping mr rudin hunt down people he wants to speak with and dodge the ones he doesn't the third-ranking assistant handles documents including faxes and emails no keeps an eye on mr rudin's personal business and three homes in new york city quogue long island and washington conn fifth keeps tabs on the theater and art worlds informing him of new shows and upcoming exhibitions although that spot is currently vacant yet another assistant handles telephones and errands in l.a. the assistants tasks are by turns glamorous and mundane on occasional saturdays the weekend's on-call assistant rotating position has stood outside times square theater waiting with tickets in case mr rudin wanted to attend show if he didn't show up the assistant could use them former assistants say they have handled chores such as returning videotapes dropping off dry-cleaning and picking up rotisserie chicken but they can also find themselves in hollywood meetings with the likes of nicole kidman jude law or jim carrey for the hot-seat assistant the day starts with 6:00 a.m run to mr rudin's apartment in the san remo building on manhattan's central park west where he lives with his partner of seven years john barlow founder of new york public-relations firm that focuses on broadway shows there the aide retrieves the boss's list of outstanding phone calls often 30 pages long which mr rudin has annotated during the night given mr rudin's dealings in london new york and los angeles calls must be prioritized according to time zone and urgency mr rudin usually arrives at work around 6:30 a.m at which time the hot-seat assistant begins dialing his company has just 18 employees and since mr rudin involves himself in nearly every aspect of production from securing adaptation rights to marketing the finished product the volume of calls is heavy he says he makes or receives about 400 in an average day mr rudin says he is regularly shocked by the lack of cultural knowledge in his work force he once asked an assistant to get dvd of the 1952 film the member of the wedding but when he mentioned the name of the director the staffer didn't recognize it mr rudin says he asked the young man your parents paid for you to go to college and you don't know who fred zinnemann is mr zinnemann also directed oklahoma high noon and the day of the jackal the producer who once forced an underling to tape sign defining the word anticipate in huge letters above his desk says that when he asks follow-up questions about work assistants often look back at him like i'm speaking urdu he tells them when ask you these questions have an answer ready then would think you're intelligent he is also known for wicked sense of humor when one assistant routinely sported ink-stained shirt pockets mr rudin bought him half-dozen expensive dress shirts at bergdorf goodman which he then had an intern spot with ink blotches the atmosphere drives assistants to perform remarkable tasks in may 2004 for instance director stephen daldry was climbing in the himalayas when mr rudin became desperate to show him new screenplay after an assistant got the pages into the director's hands in nepal mr daldry says he later asked mr rudin in amazement how did you find me an assistant got mr daldry's office to say where he was vacationing then hired specialty courier service to take the script to kathmandu in 1992 l.a. based assistant adam schroeder was asked to deliver an offer to author terry mcmillan whose best-seller waiting to exhale was the subject of bidding war mr schroeder says he flew to san francisco on the fourth of july then drove to her suburban home where she answered the door in bathrobe even after mr schroeder helped the writer's little boy search for lost rabbit mr rudin didn't get the film rights the loss didn't get mr schroeder fired he now operates his own production outfit in hollywood ms mcmillan declined to comment other times when things go wrong mr rudin lets loose former assistants say he sometimes vents his anger by throwing phones and office supplies prompting assistants to take precautions some feared mr rudin might hurl an easily accessible framed picture on his desk so they surreptitiously moved it out of his reach others measured mr rudin's phone cord so they could keep the appropriate distance the rookies often stood too close remembers mr evans mr rudin says he's thrown things occasionally but very rarely under such pressure assistants feel compelled to push themselves connor price who was the no assistant for time last year spent sick day at home alternately vomiting and giving instructions to his co-workers until mr rudin finally told them to stop calling mr price might have had reason to be nervous shortly after being hired he came across note in which another assistant wrote to mr rudin regarding connor price know your first impressions weren't great in fact you called this guy an idiot adam rosenberg who spent six months working for mr rudin last year was petrified after the boss found fault with an art-journal piece he had translated from french mr rosenberg couldn't define what specific words meant in english what are you doing don't want you messing around he says mr rudin reprimanded he gave me lecture about not paying attention to set things right mr rosenberg got to the office at 5:30 the next morning and called the article's french author for literal translation when mr rudin who doesn't speak french called in mr rosenberg recited the piece word-for-word he recalls mr rudin's response ok followed by hang-up mr rudin says he did get points for speaking french the prize for surviving mr rudin's hazing is first-hand education in being hollywood shark the producer for example tries to make sure business associates owe him call rather than the other way around by having his assistants call contacts at times when they're unlikely to answer leaving messages instead at one time terry press head of marketing at dreamworks had nighttime voicemail greeting that said if you're anyone other than scott rudin's office please leave message we have been guilty of dumping calls occasionally mr rudin concedes working for mr rudin also offers access to the sort of high-level hollywood executives unseen by most starting assistants as young grunt working for the producer in the early 1990 brandon camp met actor tim robbins and sherry lansing then paramount's studio chief he notes mr rudin's knack for finding movie fodder sometimes when still in manuscript form he'll say this book is going to be an incredible hit and everybody says well maybe'...and the book turns out to be the firm says mr camp the rudin-produced movie version of the john grisham thriller made more than 150 million at theu.s box office mr rudin credits his young staffers with providing him with some helpful tips years ago it was an assistant who first drew his attention to the below-the-radar movie bottle rocket the directorial debut of wes anderson now one of mr rudin's favorite creative minds you cannot overestimate the contribution that they make being 22 year-old guys who like movies and music and bands he says mr rudin tries to ease life for his staff with generous compensation and occasional gifts it's bad enough i'm sure that they feel emotionally exploited he says don't want them to feel commercially exploited as well perks have ranged from the week-long nantucket vacation he purchased for onetime assistant kevin walsh to the mini cooper he gave mark roybal former assistant soon to be named the company's president as wedding gift rudin alums have powerful bond at mr roybal's wedding two years ago 13 former assistants attended as well as the producer himself some have gone into business together like movie producers lars knudsen and beau flynn once year derek skaletsky who worked for mr rudin in the late 1990 and now works for children's haircut franchise near boston gets together with half-dozen old rudin productions buddies for steak dinner everybody in hollywood tries to be tough but not many people have the game says mr skaletsky rudin's got it
sadly very true it makes sense all the writers on the show know the industry intimately and take from their real lives the big difference is that everything always seems to work out for vinnie chase the reality is that that's rarely the case
for films times out of 10 the ap credit is for an assistant or underling who found the script its just nice way of repaying them executive producers are the ones with big egos who need filling executive producers rarely earn their title its mostly monetary thing television ap is given to staff writer who has been around long enough and taken more responsibilities in the day to day writing process
because people go and see them and the studio makes money just the way it is audiences are sheep all they need is shit blowing up flashy advertising loud sounds and bam what would be amazing is if people actually read reviews before seeing movies and dictated that intelligent innovative films got their ticket money
yeap so are vin diesel and hugh jackman
who you know 100 i'll reference an arrested development gag tobias creating buzz around the water cooler tobias fünke that funke is some kind of something boy this funke is all anybody's ever talking about so sick and tired of hearing about how brilliant that funke is overrated sadly this is how people get hired word of mouth
of course its stupid and honestly no one pirates movies as much as people in the film industry want to guess where all those oscar and post-production screeners come from i'm sure if you can come up with system that guarantees content providers get paid when people use their content then they'll support you but what drm and mpaa are doing is the act of desperation they see their usual theatrical and home video sales going down and they can only point to piracy so until someone comes up with better system netflix then this is what they'll do
my boss is no scott rudin both in good and bad respects but he certainly relies on myself and others at the company to bring ideas and scripts to him in most ways though i'd argue he's more hip than me i'm 24
well worded it trains me to know what to look out for and how to tailor to my audience the frustrating thing is that its easier to destroy than it is to create so unlike most of my colleagues try to give each script its fair due know its hard enough just to finish it let alone to get the courage to find an agent and get it to producer
no guidelines its all up to me if like something fight for it if think its terrible say so another sad little secret about the industry is that no one actually reads anything the studio head the studio exec the producer are only reading coverage synopsis and review of script usually 2-5 pages usually written by an assistant an intern or hired reader only that coverage is ever looked out so its very likely that the movies you are watching started when an unpaid intern sitting in cramped office somewhere in the valley liked script and wrote glowing review lot of producers like to specialize in certain genres but lot are just on the lookout for whatever they know can sell actually big business is just selling spec script that never actually get made zach helm actually was succesful writer who had never written anything that got made that was of course until he wrote his manifesto http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/03/windolf200603
i'm talking mostly about directors/writers actors are another game entirely the best bet director has is to make something cheap that is hit on the festival circuit that'll usually get the attention of agents at least until the heat wheres off the tricky thing to do is to easily and quickly make that transition from an indie director to one who can work in the studiosystem lot of good talent aren't really prepared for the barrage of attention one of the best advice ever got as director is to always have an opinion when you walk into those meetings at the studio they won't care if you liked their project or not they just want to believe you know how to make it better writers are sort of crapshoot lot of writers make it by submitting to screenwriting contests and some assistant somewhere will get hold of the winners and get manager interested but by and large the majority of represented writers will make their in by writing an amazing script and have someone pass it along to manager who will take chance on it the way the system is set up is that its insulated for example if someone writes script and calls an agent and says read my script and the script sucks which 99 do then the agent wasted his time but if third party manager sends the script and the script sucks then that agent will know not to trust that manager the next time around but obviously writer will always think is own material is amazing so as frustrating as the system is its also necessity if writing/directing is what you want to do then do it write...direct do it on your free time eventually if what you make is good enough someone will see the potential in it don't try writing one thing and bang on every door in hollywood its waste of everyone's time don't be this guy http://www.everyonewhosanyone.com
worked for far more terrible and demanding organization http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/creative_artists_agency
i'm hopeful its the latter but honestly luck has lot to do with it
keep writing and keep applying to fellowships there's no magic trick to it the ideal job for you would be an assistant in the writer's room of new show those are hard to come by but if you're fortunate enough to be in los angeles there's always someone who you can talk to about interning somewhere to get you close to that spot
depends on the movie if its tentpole big studio picture they're clearly not going to give it to kid fresh out of filmschool but if that kid made something really interesting that got lot of attention at festivals then he might be considered for something that has low budget the thing that they really have to do is wow the studio execs in meeting they basically pit directors against one another and pick the one they feel is best suited to the job that includes price experience and vision for the movie
because people go and see it the trend is really just trying to get the rights to brand names and then making movie work around that if you don't want it to happen stop seeing these kind of movies and stop your friends too
honestly don't have the highest respect for actors writers do wish could name specific names but i'm nervous about that but sometimes you'll talk to someone who should be the biggest asshole but they arn't the most talented people don't let it get to their heads they're perfectly accessible to nobodies and the heads of studios its the best quality to have in this industry
sorry the show didn't work out i've lived here on permanent basis and never stayed at hotel in that part of town let me think about it google is probably your best bet
that's good point let me hack the mainframe and get you an answer my guess is that hollywood's history with military consultants goes back aways so those relationships are already there whereas technology is always accessible to laymen so anyone thinks they can be an expert on the subject
that's always been the case for as long as networks have been around what changed is the argument for how they determine show's success ie cult following dvd sales tivo
the straightest man alive
sorry boss i'll get back to work and you can get back to making reddit user accounts on set while you're supposed to be making movies
can't really say if you've ever been to la its pretty intimidating to see how many scientology centers there are around town then again used to live next to the biggest one in hollywood and always found it odd that they had their own security/police guarding the area but who am to complain was able to walk the streets and buy my drugs without fear of getting jumped while in the shadow of that eight sided scientology cross
while have seen plenty in my time gotta frankly say that hollywood or at least the side have seen has been strangely devoid of it corporate culture has changed since the days of don simpson http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/don_simpson
again don't know enough about the specifics of certain actors but guarantee it comes down to money television actors can make decent money and depending on person's career their interests and how desperate they are for cash tv show role recurring or not can make sense and the more and more actors do it the more common it will be can only guess that trends aside big television shows have the money that's comparable to what these actors would make in films
seinfeld and frasier arn't the ideal examples frasier as you remember was spinoff so immediately it had built in audience that the network could stand behind luckily the show took off seinfeld was widly different show then the programming around it from the pilot alone you either got the show or you didn't i'd agree that networks would benefit from having shows on the air longer and sometimes they are til death is an example of show that shouldn't have been on the air as long as it was but ultimately that decision of whether to green light or cancel show is what makes or break network executive think the internet following is something that would not have been there for the traditional purely television format so it helps always sunny is show that has definitely stayed alive and prospered due to their internet following but the executives at fx had have seen that after their ratings initially sucked
they've stayed pretty much consistent runtime of around hours and 30 minutes http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2009-02-23-oscar-telecast-comparison_n.htm but sure if ever get invited to attend i'll punch the whole crew for you
http://www.hotelamarano.com
yeap pretty accurate in fact there was an agent worked with who also would do cameos in various episodes so i'd see this agent at work go home turn on the entourage and see him playing caricature of himself on tv
they definitely do netflix is definitely changing how networks/studios distribute media and likewise they'll tailor their media to fit the medium i've speculated elsewhere that its just the culture of hedging bets and cancelling shows ultimately someone's career relies on those decisions and any show has the potential to have very dedicated cult following but if it isn't enough to entice advertisers then there's simply no way around it at least using the traditional tv model
its pretty standard fact that every script from its initial spec draft goes through bunch of rewrites at the discretion of the studio occasionally if the director on the project has history of writing he'll be given the final pass so yes script does often fall apart at the hands of studio executives who are told it's there job to make changes to the script until they're happy but lot can go wrong in production too just again keep in mind every movie at one point was an idea sooo good that they put millions of dollars behind it
not me i'm sorry think he hasn't been in anything good since boiler room
this definitely plays part studios want to know that their directors will deliver the films they pitch under budget and on time but in the room they want to believe that this director understands the film better then they do keep in mind they are the ones that bought it so you as director need to convince them that you have the best vision for the film but again they're not going to meet with you unless they have that sample that suggests you're the right guy
these are all estimates assistants can make 20-70 year lifers maybe can break six digits studio execs range from 60-300 agents make base of 50-200 with huge bonuses per deals done writers can make scale http://www.wga.org/uploadedfiles/writers_resources/contracts/min2008.pdf but the good ones can make hundreds of thousands even millions per project producers directors and actors make crazy amounts depending on who they are
stunts is probably the one aspect of the industry know nothing about but given your family's history imagine they have contact at some stunt house somewhere who could take you on as an intern consider maybe attending one of these to make initial contacts http://www.actionfilmworkshops.com
don't really agree with that statement think the trend lately is for upcoming foreign film directors commercial and music video directors were very popular in the late 80 and 90 because it allowed for them to hone their craft and specific styles this lead to good samples and experience to bring to the table when they finally made the transition to feature directors but in the next 3-5 years expect huge influx of eastern european asian and south american directors who specialize in cheap realistic special effects becoming the norm
credits are big deal they're written into contracts and negotiated its very difficult to get the final card the and edward norton usually the first billed actor gets there own card and then less important people share cards but intro logo's are broken down like this studio/final financier if purchased after festival run main producer's production company or original financier 2nd production company usually an actors production company or rights holders 3rd production company director or actor's company its just matter of distributing credit amongst those involved in bringing the project together its myth that the vision of project falls solely on the director or the writer or producer it truly is collaborative process technically its the producer who selects the director so the director will always back down to what the producer wants the separation lies between final cut only in extremely rare circumstances will the director or producer have final cut over the studio
agents are regulated by the state they can only make 10 and they cannot produce their clients projects agents usually have upwards of 30-50 clients managers are not regulated they can make anywhere from 20 depending on their arrangement they can produce their clients projects they usually have more manageable client load of 10-20 entertainment attorneys are regulated they can only make they often have 50-100 clients as they're only used during negotiations talent can survive with just and agent or manager/attorney combo more often the not they have all three rarely some only have an attorney but these are the most sought after people
its not hard landing on set as pa grips camera assistants ect are all union controlled so its best to try to land couple pa jobs to see what it is that really interests you you do not do not have to go to film school to get job in hollywood did but assure you there is nothing learned in classroom that couldn't have figured out by being on set just show up and learn its very hands on sort of industry where you only learn by doing it grip sets up lighting per the director of photography's direction see below http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/143794/movie_set_terminology_film_crew_jobs.html
to play devil's advocate lets say made movie and put it on youtube there's no doubt that it'll get widely seen which is great for me as an artist but lets assume paid for that movie out of my pocket then i'm shit out of lot of money movies are expensive however if hand out copies of the movie on dvd and know that people are paying me directly for my content then i'll have the money to do it again now for bands its simple you distribute your music widely so you have fan base then you play shows and sell merchandise to make your money its win-win but there's no equivalent for filmmakers either they sell their films to distributer or the share it freely and don't make any money think subscription service like netflix or an advertisement based one like hulu is as close as its going to get for widely distributing films/tv without breaking the bank through the process and know personally lot of people prefer to watch movies in cinema experience which is why think the theater option will always be possibility
wish there was simple formula to determine show's longevity but its up to people to pick the shows create shows and eventually cancel the shows and humans are quite fallible
agree and think that eventually something will get worked out you can't deny there's base for content delivered online just fundamentally don't see version of it where the content is simply free films and television shows are usually way too expensive to make purely for arts sake
agreed have you gotten much work now as director or are you still doing 2nd unit stuff
again get nervous about naming specific names and for the most part the majority of actors are decent normal people who are just doing their jobs its certain people who take too much liberty with their position and throw it around
personally prefer the bbc model for shows which seems to generally have shows run for 2-4 seasons max don't know if this is just trend in lot of my favorite shows or genuine rule but think it forces the creators to be clever about the storylines and prevents shows from running past their prime it also sets the stage for lot of new ideas to find time each season
sorry if that's not what you wanted to hear but its the truth you cant just show up at studio and convince them you're amazing you'll need something viable to prove it and unlike any other aspect of the industry you're almost guaranteed attention if you do well at any of the major festivals or if you do something unique on the internet that brings alot of attention the guy who directed the texting while driving psa is pretty big this week who knows he could parlay it into studio gig
just googled that huh really don't know my guess is as good as yours http://www.youtube.com/watch xp8ic4-x_qg if you think of anything non-piven related let me know

there's simply no easy answer like anything else in this world as long as you believe in what you're doing and are willing to face regection for years without hope of success then you've got shot in general actors with specific look seem to do better than those who don't worked for casting agency for short while and that really is just pure crapshoot again per david cross right now there are million people in la who are all going to make it...maybe 13 are actually going to make it 14 if you count the girl who went on blinddate then posed for hustler if that's your idea of making it then yeah lets juice that up to 14
very serious
all hollywood companies hire interns without question to their experience special effect houses are much more accessible than acting they'll take you in and teach you their craft its definitely good in and fortunately special effects houses are located all over the world so you don't necessarily have to be in los angeles
we don't really run in the same circles but if see him i'll say this is for one time and he'll be confused which will make the bashing easier
nope not until you find consistent work lot of it is paying out of your own pocket or borrowing from friends and family but the more you do the more experience you'll have and the better you'll be at doing it for living while don't really care for him as director respect him as filmmaker i'd recommend you read robert rodriguez's book for inspiration http://www.amazon.com/rebel-without-crew-23-year-old-filmmaker/dp/0452271878
was it the the graciela burbank its now called the hotel amarano http://www.hotelamarano.com
really never understood the fixation with the casting couch something about desperation in people guess
dvd sales b-movies or rather what we think of as b-movies and not actually b-movies from the 70 that were used as filler inbetween studio movies have an extremely viable market in dvd sales blockbuster has ton of arrangements with financiers who back films for usually around 1-2 million and can guarantee themselves profit from the dvd arrangements napoleon dynamite is one such example of success story the producers raised million dollars from various financiers they spent 500 on napoleon dynamite but to assure their backers would get return they kept the other 500 with the intention of making straight to dvd horror movie that they knew they could make 1million back fortunately napoleon was hit and they never had to make the horror movie
best of luck to you hopefully will cross paths at some point
sorry it works for me maybe http://kiwi6.com/file id x0i364ra
http://www.deadline.com/hollywood/ed-norton-and-marvel-in-a-hulk-ing-feud ed norton marvel final cut debacle and just for kicks tony kaye who directed ed norton in american history had similar experience http://www.filmvault.com/filmvault/nash/a/americanhistoryx1.html
nope studios and financiers cough up cash i've broken down the difference somewhere else here but basically feature creative producer packages material finds the script attaches director and talent and then sells it to the studio and then tries to make sure the film comes in as asked by the studio the line producer has to secure locations and crew and budget the film they deal with the day to day problems of production permits rights ect
and like mentioned that's an extremely rare scenario giving up final cut is akin to surgeon giving the patient the scalpel only the very best could truly know how to edit themselves better then professional
nope just prick who makes lot of money closing deals
its kind of ironic but the price increase while complete bullshit in la its 14 for theater tickets the price difference is meant to represent the revenue lost to piracy which is sadly the case
no problem
haha i'd say all of the above usually feature productions are all planned out and set up for way in advance but ultimately things go haywire and production becomes grueling experience but the fun thing is that you know there's an end point and everyone works together until they get the shot off there's something rewarding about contributing one small part to large production knowing that without you it couldn't have happened the unions have set hours to force major productions to try not to run late as they have tendency to do so often when location or person is unavailable after certain day then people are often asked to work 16-20 hours to get the shot off the result is unfortunately high number of car accidents for crew who nod off while driving home but i'd say for the most part its fun communal experience
nope before lumberg's time on the show
you're welcome if anything comes to mind i'm still checking in
there are number of agencies in la that specialize in non-union extras you sign up their automated message will let you know where you need to show up the next day and there you will sit for 10-12 hours moving or standing as needed sound fun http://www.centralcasting.org
not yet although have worked on movie that was about the porn industry and we hired former porn stars and shot at mansion where porn had been shot so essentially we made porn without sex
you're putting the cart before the horse write the show first then try to find someone to produce it if you can't find anyone to produce it and you really believe in the project then you'll just have to find the financing credit cards/loan its how lot of success stories start jon favreau kevin smith and robert rodriguez come to mind
no that's too optimistic it's more like stumbling across this http://www.cinemablend.com/new/view-master-the-movie-13820.html and then you realize they're seriously going to make view master the movie and you die little inside
thanks chyndonax let me know if you think of anything
think its because of two fundamentally different creative processes games are meant to be world creating and entertaining for 72 hours where as films are designed to tell story in unique world for hours plus there's always gap between the creative people who came up with the videogame and their counterpart who has to deliver solid idea based on the material to studio who has their own vision of what the videogame based movie should be
personally i'm big fan of foreign films in general my experience with other industries has been pretty minimal american productions often shoot up in canada vancouver for tax rebates i've visited fox studios in sydney and it was ghost town the aus to us dollar isn't really favorable to productions right now as for the rest of the world's film business must admit i'm pretty clueless one of the fascinating things about european filmmaking is the fact that most countries provide film fund to help develop local films which obviously was counter measure to combat hollywood but its fascinating to think that government would take time to finance films its such crazy concept here in the states
awkward since both usually take place in bathroom of some cramped club
no problem
good point guess meant to say its great that they got the opportunity to make whatever they wanted next
the documentary genre has been around as long as film has the earliest films focused on people's fascination with movement human culture and world travels the only recent development has been the blockbuster documentary which is heavily advertised docs that revolve around central character moore gore or morgan freeman's voice but the recent political-squed ones moore gore tend to focus less on an omniscient narrator discussing broad unarguable facts to loaded conversation its still interesting and great that non-fiction has proven profitable but still you need to be wary of theater going trends in general when times are bad war economy people flock to fictional escapism when things are relatively calm non-fiction seems to find its way to the forefront i'd say we're due for plenty more escapism
thanks pretty much would have done the same thing ace is the editors guild there's guild for every major union sag/aftra for actors dga for directors wga for writers pga for producers http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:entertainment_industry_unions
honestly no this is the one thing i'm sure want to do more so than anything else what specifically will be doing in the industry is open to debate but love the idea of taking people away from their worlds too much not to do this
deal
like any job its something people fall into it takes certain quality to be able to meet someone and categorize what their look is so that later you can reference them essentially casting director will be given list of roles to cast and will have to use information from the script to decide who would be ideal then to see what the price range is and consider options for who would work best this includes every speaking role in the film its process that involves working as an assistant at casting company and familiarizing yourself with the up and coming faces of which there are hundreds if not thousands for any given look
well can't speak to the phrase per-say however have had close friends who did do the extra thing for quite sometime and you'll definitely have stories there are some crazy people who do background work the other side of background work is seeing how people try to break in one of the most desirable things to attain as non-union extra are sag cards collect three sag cards and you can join the union however getting sag card is difficult and sometimes painful process but its certainly worth pursuing if you have free time and some some extra cash
slipped meant sag voucher know there are certain loopholes to the system for all sag signatories ie any major studio if character speaks then they must be union so if someone has speaking line then the studio must sponser their union application so they don't get fined for using non-union actor so more often then not when extras are seen talking in movies/tv they're actually just moving their mouths if they utter words it can become problem another thing is if background player becomes central figure in scene this might happen while on set either because an actor doesn't show look the part or the director just wants to try the scene different way found this link it has more information http://www.hollywoodaccess.com/sag.htm
internet/digital distribution is great for artists its great way to get your work out to the masses quickly but as viable business model just don't see it if mst3k was brand new youtube sensation then where would the money go to fund the show and more importantly obtain the rights to the films they use in the show think that hulu/netflix are an ideal method of distribution however unlike the traditional method of television programming where audiences are introduced to new shows simply by being on before or after popular show how exactly will networks get people interested in new shows if they can only watch specifically the content they paid for
might also be another exception but both of these were before he defined his action career as chronicles of riddick triple and fast and furious
there's no easy answer its complicated problem and media conglomerate is usually the last to jump on board something fully until all the kinks have been worked out that being said you might like boldly going nowhere its new show from the creators behind always sunny in philadelphia its parody of 1970 sci-fi shows its very much in the vein of mst3k and it'll hopefully be out next season perhaps on hulu/netflix/youtube
not really my background is mostly with directors/writers but anyone worth damn wouldn't need to use system like that they'll usually have their own catalogue suspect that services like talenthunter just take money from desperate actors with no real expectation of their service being widely used in the industry
casablanca children of men leon eternal sunshine of the spotless mind groundhog day are just few that come to mind dexter the wire always sunny in philadelphia curb your enthusiasm
think that personally there is certain contingent of people who prefer to watch movies in theater setting but it would be stupid to ignore the growing trend for people who prefer to watch movies in the comfort of their home so while think technology and business models will shift to allow people to watch movies instantly at their home their will always be model for people to watch things in the theater but aside from having filmmakers tour the country selling dvds shirts and books about the movie at every single screening then there's no way to use the concert method as similar example
no he just got pidgeon holed into making those kind of movies so unless you need someone to blow up car and jason statham isn't available you use vin
was just in an ed norton frame of mind but yeah he's got reputation for being controlling read those two articles for context
there are similar rackets for writers there are online screenwriting contests which cost 30-100 dollars per submission and they guarantee your script will be reviewed by an industry professional the truth is couple assistants will flip through it and collect check themselves another similiar scam are these things called pitchfests where writers pay crazy amount to come pitch industry professionals again its usually assistants who sit at desk for hours on end listening to desperate writers nodding their heads and collecting check i'd say if you really want to pursue acting try your best to stand out in your hometown and if you really believe in yourself then you'll just need to make the move to big town ny chicago or la
not like my tastes are any more weighted or give any extra insight because films are my career
it has lot to do with the foresight of their agents if they're able to chart career path that matches high salary with oscar worthy performances then they have shot but if that agent is just focused on turning their client into the big action star and only taking the franchise big budget pictures then sure enough they will be defined by that
the best agents make their clients feel like any career choices was really their ideas the best talent agents ari emanuel ed limato and bryan lourd
if you're serious and in la can try to set you up with an internship
you've got misguided grasp of the pecking order on set the assistant director or ad is arguably the most important person on set they literally control everything schedule who goes where when people can break and what goes on when although an assistant to producer doesn't command that same respect one would be foolish to piss off the assistant to the most powerful guy on set
there's also some good ones out there just luck landing in the right place
my guess is it was probably just pa or at best 2nd ad which is an assistant to the ad
think more likely this type of language will be the norm and using traditional english will be thought of as pompous and faggy

consider no qualified health benefits plan ombudsman this person or office would be charged with helping people navigate the new health reform system and report to congress on recommendations for improvements in administration of the program it's part of the health choices administration no on the list that sounds like double-counting to us and that's true of number of other items on the list as well four of the items on the list include the creation of various trust funds these are new funds but they are to be created by existing agencies these are essentially bank accounts those aren't new government bureaucracies in our book the list also includes six pilot programs and three demonstration programs the list also includes three new ombudsmen and special inspector general for the health insurance exchange three items on the list deal with comparative effectiveness research although the government already does such research we think it's fair to count the creation of new center for comparative effectiveness research on the list but the next two items comparative effectiveness research commission and patient ombudsman for comparative effectiveness research seems like triple-dipping that's 20 that they debunk but its stan dorn who suggests its actually 36 but the other 16 are not specifically broken down
there are music supervisors for any given production generally for television its done by the network for features its done by studio often the creative talent involved can suggest song choices but its really up to the music departments to find the best music that fits the given subject and its up to them to acquire the rights it's not an area of expertise i'd check with joe escalante http://www.barelylegalradio.com
he should be rewarded for accuracy in advertising at least he does something truthful

let me introduce you to the concept of hypocrisy it is an unfortunate dimension of the human condition doubly so for republicans quadruply so for the god-fearing right it's the amazing ability to force your beliefs on others without the nagging concern to live by those beliefs or to truly consider the grander costs of the implementation and upkeep of those belief systems in you know...the real world
op agree with unemployed it has lot to do with noam chomsky's concept of manufacturing consent http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manufacturing_consent and he's got point you won't find any poll that states the republican consensus was at 80 the largest figure found was on fox news article that had it at 26 you clearly feel very passionately about your opinion but you're just getting angry at people who are trying to have intelligent discourse with you simply because they disagree interestingly enough this is perfect example of manufacturing consent the vast majority of the people who read your post won't have strong enough opinion either way to post something those that do and you agree with you'll leave alone those that have differing opinion even those that don't you'll shut them down with crass words and fake facts you are doing on micro-level exactly what pisses you off on the national level most people are pretty indifferent to the wellbeing of anyone beyond their immediate selves often those that protest against seemingly shared belief in humanism do so at the suggestion of their indoctrinated religious beliefs their indoctrinated political beliefs or the socially acceptable belief which is definitive the socio-economic class and culture to which they belong the question is is this opinion being represented by the media/politicians or is it responding to media/politicians there's no easy answer

but it does suggest that lenders and loan servicers take steps to screen and identify strategic defaulters in advance and possibly avoid offering them loan modifications since they'll probably just re-default on them anyway what load of crap if they had modified my mortgage as requested wouldn't ever be looking at walking away as it is offered to pay off principal at lower rate and they said no--dumb-asses so i'm walking away they can eat the two hundred grand loss fuck them
djhwilliams do know of aftrs but think might be one of the few here in hollywood that does the reason know of aftrs is that actually worked on student film there while visiting few years ago its great program and it's very much unlike anything in the united states its difficult program to get into think its like people accepted per semester and generally they expect you to have plenty of industry experience under your belt before you can apply however if you do get in you'll be able to work on short funded by the school directly which as mentioned is unlike anything we do over here stateside also north ryde is close enough to sydney to make it worth your while if you're not local cheers

used to do volunteer work at prison i'd meet 20 guys or so out of 800 in that section of the prison each month to talk about whatever one time asked the prison coordinator if they had any serial killers figuring that one or two of the 800 might have killed few people she responded almost cheerfully oh yeah you know herbie he killed 27 women it hadn't occurred to me that one of the guys i'd met and been talking to over the previous couple of years might have been serial killer herbie was very nice gentle mellow guy in my experience of course then looked on the internet for info on serial killer named herbie who had killed 27 women in my state but didn't find anything knew the coordinator fairly well and don't think she was lying but i'm not sure what to think maybe 27 women isn't such huge total anymore

wonder if some of my conservative friends feel the same way about rush as do about michael moore--i love him though don't agree with everything he says like his ideology even though don't really think it works forgive him for his selective presentation of facts because well he's on our side
note to self log of computer when going to work okay the guy's bit loopy in my book as well but he's definitely got right to privacy and his wife probably should have respected that right scat is gross just making sure that was printed by my name
have great sex life with my wife--who love and have no intention of ever screwing other women in the ass--but if my wife knew would want to do that she might not be so happy that is completely normal--to keep things from your wife that she might not think are such great ideas
will agree with most of what you have written however other than the hitting on foreign student there's no evidence that what the husband had written was day to day thing driving his existing sex life it could be fantasy world think his fantasizing about degrading women is sad and sick but if it's just fantasy never acted upon and his married life is otherwise normal as it seems to have been for seven years don't think the wife did anything more than invade his privacy
think bill is funny--i think michael is heartwarming in his naivete think rush is fucking prick and strangely enough think ann has fantasit comic timing though think she's fucking bitch since we're discussing everyone
4000 posts definitely sounds like lot--but over what period of time he could be whipping out 10 in ten minutes--if so then ten minutes day for little over year is the 4000 more likely it's over longer period of time point is their relationship appears to have been working sure the guy sounds like creep--but all men are in some way deep down i'll give five to one you're woman certainly could be wrong
if it works then it works people can go their whole lives without sharing some things with those closest to them that doesn't mean the relationship doesn't work just because you think it's important to share everything men and women have different conceptions as to the importance of various things in relationship it's just fact if you think you know everything about what your husband thinks and feels you're kidding yourself
i'm not sure what you mean by lot think i'm talking about one concept--one you clearly think is important as does the wife in this case you say it's not important that they share everything but you definitely want to approve of everything not shared--or you wouldn't be taking this course my point is if you don't know about it it doesn't matter
yes it's pretty black and white--if the wife didn't know about his internet usage or his fantasies she wouldn't care and it apparently hasn't hurt them up to now

this cbs article on the same story http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/09/29/crimesider/entry5351308.shtml has some much more interesting details gt it's hard to have quiet moments because my kids words haunt me in those quiet times christopher savoie said recently before his trip to japan gt early monday savoie apparently picked them up as they walked to school according to friend and witness shannon higgins but instead of heading to the nearest airport savoie drove straight to the nearest u.s. consulate where japanese police were waiting gt apparently alerted by savoie's ex-wife japanese police blocked the road near the consulate higgins said then savoie got out of the car and ran gt so there was that first barricade and then once they got to the gate the u.s. consulate did not open the gate he recalled like scene from movie higgins said isaac froze in the streets as his dad raced toward the consulate with rebecca in his arms he was there chris with little girl in his arms crying please help please help we're american citizens please let us through and they simply did not open the gate they did not let us through higgins added

clearly you don't know what the fuck you're talking about california has the about the smallest per-person government of any state
how many government workers per capita does utah have tax revenue per capita does not necessarily equal state workers also in direct cost cost of living in california is going to be higher also grabbing data after the fact to back up position is not evidence of knowing what you were talking about--especially when your evidence is not to the point
thank you for pointing out my mistake am california state worker and we have waste here however have been in the military and have worked private sectar as well and know there is waste everywhere stand by my assertion that california state government is more efficient than most--see here http://www.ccsce.com/pdf/numbers-oct08-govt-employees.pdf on thing remember telling people five years ago when couldn't find any good job applicants i'm an engineer with staff was that when the economy is good nobody wants to work here because our pay was mediocre and there is no chance of hitting it big i.e bonuses/raises and when times are tough everyone wants to work here am surprised at the backlash we receive now--but i'm more surprised at the lack of knowledge displayed by those attackers perhaps you passed up state job five years ago and are now pissed
guess am annoyed at the attacks we receive our pay has been cut 15 this year for the entire decade of the 90 we received like total in raises while the outside world of engineers got like 40-50 that got pretty old at that point did work pretty hard now i'm somewhat redundant turning into that bad-attitude state-worker hated when was young but my spending met my income so that 15 cut does make things stressful it's one thing to take job knowing your economy dependent but at the state we sacrificed opportunity maybe because we're lazy for security oh well that's gone too no worries--we'll survive
no worries i'm giving house back to the bank now but i'll survive have another smaller one to move in to i'll grant that the argument can be made that state workers can be inefficient but since there's no profit motive and no profits given to stakeholders it's about the same as if the private sectar did this work was surprised at the third the first was like oh well and the second was oh shit things will be tight the third was well bad
could have kept the house but wouldn't have been able to keep up with the credit card bills figured could walk away from the house with impunity but not the credit cards as had another house to move to the choice seemed obvious to me i'm okay with it it's only hard when think of all the work did on that house over the years oh well have to do analysis based on the future not the past motivation at work is fluid like the good feeling of getting something done but there is no real downside to getting distracted our system does have problems in that lazy/useless people are rarely disciplined because it's such pain for the supervisor but the net effect to our clients the taxpayers is negligible the money that's lost in laziness is more than counterbalanced by the greed of the private sectar i've worked with enough private engineers over the years to know that they have deadwood and incompetence in their ranks as well but when you're working in the gray areas of opinion you can't be accused of incompetence
was bill o'reilly dick off-air too
fuck that made me laugh out loud not belly laugh but still well worth feeling

think the point of the quote is that nuclear weapons for all is as stupid as guns for all even if all but felons owned guns it would be much less safe than it is now because it would be even easier for them to obtain them regarding the fact you know several people who put food on the table with guns--who gives shit they don't need to it's hugely unlikely any substantial percent of their intake calories need to be killed by gun it's bullshit
the rose by bette midler
just like in afghanistan where all the males own guns nobody ever gets fucking shot bullshit abundance of weapons does not make anything safer the reason the us had used the nuclear bomb wasn't because they were the only ones to have it--they used to avoid killing million people on an invasion and because they had spent two billion 1945 dollars developing the fucking thing
don't object to those people putting food on their table or keeping that gun--i object to them insisting that almost everyone should have gun or at least have the right to the gun wide proliferation of these guns does not serve any purpose related to the original meaning of the 2nd amendment and don't try to convince me that it does it only serves to make our lives less safe and keep your fucked up quote about safety and liberty right up your ass where it belongs please the point is that times have changed and wide proliferation of guns is not necessary for most americans today--and believe most shouldn't have them have friend who's son was shot in the face by the ex-husband of his girlfriend--don't tell me wide proliferation of cheap and easily accessible guns doesn't affect me it affects us all tangentially keep hunting rifle or two licensed and secured for your personal use--just quit insisting everyone in my subdivision has the right to one it wouldn't affect your life at all if you had just one or two guns
wonder if people can learn to shoot heroin like gentleman given practice and moderation
don't honestly believe in completely banning guns have made no detailed thoughts on exactly what policy should be and really don't care to think easy access to guns is bad policy don't think the founding fathers would have envisioned today's situation hence don't think the more popular amongst the the gun crowd interpretations of the 2nd amendment apply that's my opinion and hell if it were explicit as if they envisioned the gun nuts in my building as the militia then i'd think it needed to be repealed one other thing since you have different motivation than i--i don't believe that the ones who have gone through emotional upheaval should be the ones making policy don't think victims of abuse should be on jury--and don't think you being victim of tragedy are good candidate to make gun policy for the rest of us your story is sad one and think you should have the right given proper training/background check to carry firearm--but don't think you should force your views on others either good luck
have been sober in aa for over 13 years have been an atheist all along and maybe because i'm in the us do see quite few jesus-people in meetings it's plain to see that they believe that the higher power of aa is thin veil disguising the christian god so people will have an easier time coming to god would ask for citation for your suggestion that it has been scientifically proven that aa is genetic certainly alcohol abuse may be passed down because kids mimic their parents doubt that the alcoholism gene has been found or that it even exists in fact alcoholism or whatever you want to call it--i almost prefer asshole-ism is so prevalent that there could be any number of reasons why nobody chooses to be an alcoholic just as nobody chooses to be an asshole--some of us just are and do believe that practice of the 12 steps can help one overcome some of that asshole-ed-ness that consumes us and coincidentally help with the whole alcohol problem aa dogma states lot about alcoholism which it never could and cannot now back up just parroting the bs that bill wilson made up might make us feel good in meetings and it might lure others into the cult but it's not correct you yourself direly want to explain away your atheism in aa by calling it belief in something else--but face it bill wilson espoused belief in supernatural god and he believed in an alcoholism that was just as fake let the scientists study what there is to learn about alcoholist--and when we can we can spread the truth the useful part of aa to those who can benefit
you actually don't understand my beliefs--i could give shit what the founding fathers would have thought with respect to various items they couldn't have conceived--nuclear arms stem cells assault weapons indeed what they themselves thought on some matters clearly don't agree with period--they certainly thought free men meant only free white men--not women not blacks hell probably not even non-land-owners there was certainly dissention among the founding fathers on some ideas you can pick and choose all the old quotes you want but it doesn't affect my feelings about what the second amendment means to us today even if there were enough people have no idea if there are who agreed with changing the 2nd amendment to clarify certain points such as what militia means it would never be changed because of our system--hence have little respect for it's application
don't know if there is an official policy i'm wondering if care enough to ask wonder if i'd be more likely to ask if they were christian because i'd be less likely to be branded racist or prejudiced if complained about christians another fanatical atheist
is there like whole slew of people who don't read things try reading again--i never said pakistan was in the middle east
not hospital--many large work places have lay-down room for the women with cramps ask the women in your workplace if you work in large office
asking muslim not to pray at work is not the same as asking someone to eat pork certainly they can leave the building to pray if they choose to use their personal time to pray as had said the guy who prays in his office never caused me to think second thought if those guys are in there praying on regular basis and you have cramps would you go in there
their prayers don't bother me as said the old pakistani guy never bothered me--but he's in his own space praying at work if they prayed in their own cubicles think would just ignore it--it wouldn't bother me
i'm atheist and i'm not sure that has anything to do with it heck i'm sure can find theists here who would feel similarly
hmmm yes if don't know about it and it doesn't affect me why would have feeling about it that's part of why asked the question the only reason know they were praying was because was walking down the hall and you can see the floor in that room through the blinds could see one of them kneeling on his blanket they they came out of the room carrying their blankets few seconds later as was still in the hall think just don't like the use of the common area at work for religious activities don't think i'd care if they were in their cubicles if were woman would probably bitch about it--but i'm not
yeah--i don't set the policy hell don't even know what the policy is for years the cot room was off of the women's bathroom and couple of years ago they remodeled and put the door off the main hall
i'll still disagree that asking them not to use the common area at work to pray is not the same as asking jew to eat pork the muslim can pray in his cubicle or leave the building in fact think praying alone is fine--there have been cases of senior personnel in our building holding christian prayer meetings in their offices and they were told to cut it out--though because they were senior and there could be complaint about preferential treatment
i'd prefer no prayer room be assigned why should the company waste resources on groups that don't include me i'm an atheist
thank you for your calm response to my quickly worded rant i'll review what wrote for clarity
re-read my rant i'm wondering where the five logical fallacies are please let me know the first i'm saying the founding fathers clearly were not envisioning all the blacks chinese atheists women and mexicans owning guns they envisioned small percentage of society owning guns for the protection of society you're not disagreeing with that you're ignoring that i'm saying don't agree with what many in the us interpret as the protections of the 2nd amendment agree the us supreme court has weighed in on this issue--and that's the final legal word nothing can do about that
whoah you think if we don't provide prayer room for muslims here we'll lose pool of candidates i'll have to disagree with you if devout muslims represented large percentage of the applicants it might be something to consider but it's not religious tolerance in the workplace need not include providing prayer area for every subgroup who wants to pray the fact that it's just one means nothing
haven't stated as much but if you read articles of problems with this in great britain think you'll see it didnt start as monopoly there either--yet they have problems with competition for the open spaces when it gets to that point think it's already gone too far would just prefer them not using the common areas at all for their religious needs
my company has hired many many talented muslims you clearly have no knowledge of our hiring practices or talent pools having interviewed and hired many professionals over the past decade would be fine with losing whatever talent saw this as dealbreaker i'm sure if used the cramp room to do something could do at my cubicle i'd get funny look from the women pumping their breasts
i'll mention that to the other 90 of the muslims who work here who don't pray during lunch the point was using work resources for religious activities think would more readily object to christians doing this edited to remove name calling which at the time was satisfying
not just now--there's recession going on
thanks for your input noted you can go back to masturbatingrightnow
maybe they're as afraid of being labeled bigot as am and wouldn't mention it even if they were annoyed
if you read the article many many people here are different from me honestly love that about where work love to learn about different cultures and love to travel don't know anyone who works in more diverse environment than where work my point was about people using the common area for their private religious beliefs don't know that islam is much stupider than christianity or judaism but don't particularly care for them using common areas for their rituals they may have asked where they could worship during their interview--i'm not sure as haven't been asked this question myself i'm curious to ask their supervisors
i'm questioning the propriety of them using it for their religious rituals would prefer they kept their religious observations to their cubicles or outside of work double standard would be if expected them to be treated different from christians or jews don't
am bigot because i'm complaining about muslims or would still be bigot if they were christians you may be grown-assed woman capable of standing up for yourself--but are all women if their privacy is invaded you don't think their fear of being labeled bigot could keep them quiet
i'm bitching here--not at work if were woman who's breast-pumping were interrupted in the cot room because some guys wanted to come in and practice their religion i'd be bitching at work actually here i'm expressing some thoughts in expectation of interesting commentary which might help give me context
agree about the women they should stick up for themselves don't agree about providing common area in the workplace for the practice of religion
ahh agree that treating women different from men is double standard however it's not one i've ever had to defend i've never had female staff member who was accused of spending their working hours in the cot-room so if double standard exists it's not coming from me someone else posted that the rooom is most likely there as required by law for women to pump their breasts this however has nothing to do with the muslims praying issue you seem to want to say i'm hating on the muslims am imagining that as i've said don't want anyone practicing their religion in the common areas at work
think i'd be more likely to complain if they were christian because i'd be less worried about being labeled bigot have read articles about common areas in great britain being taken over by muslims as prayer room resulting in discord at work for myself just think religion should be kept at home
thank you--i did not know that won't go changing all my postings though
i've been to prayers at the mosque before with friends know why they pray but yes your response is why posted here--i certainly don't want to be labeled the bigot don't like the office space being used for religious activities christian or jewish or muslim don't think it's appropriate but i'm not ready to complain about it maybe shouldn't based on most of the responses here it seems shouldn't wonder if this were posted in atheism if i'd get different responses
apparently someone else is more knowledgable than me about the need for the cot room it's apparently required to be there because of the size of the company and is there for women who need to pump milk while lactating you're right--there is double standard--i should complain about god not allowing me to lactate
let me ask you--as christian would you consider it your right to perform services at work
i'm guessing if hadn't mistakenly replied to your comment you wouldn't now be saying had edited my post above sorry someone else misunderstood my mentioning middle east and pakistan in close proximity to one another as meaning one was within the other
and net of zero exactly as many upvotes as down was posting for feedback on my initial gut instinct that the room probably shouldn't be used for religious purposes--and in retrospect i'd probably title it religious people using cot room at work for services or something like that i've satisfied myself that i'm basically against it for because of the religious aspect as opposed to the muslim aspect but the way wrote it it sure seems anti-muslim in any case the consensus seems to be that should ignore it--which may as well do it doesn't affect me thanks for comment
you are correct hence the deletion just fielded bunch of you're being dick comments in short period of time--same time as your comment
no please that's why posted it i'm always curious about the existence of my own prejudices that just see as common sense in this case buddhists are good point because christians mormons if you decide they're not mainstream christians scientologists and muslims would probably all bug me buddhists less so because well because of my own prejudices--i don't find them nearly as annoying or dogmatic in general though have met some dogmatic buddhists--a weird japanese sect cult had to deal with in the past but on strictly non-religious terms i'd have to object to them too it just probably wouldn't have piqued my interest were it buddhists though would have wondered why they were using the cot room which is pretty much the private room for the females in the office

know this was posted in fun tm but this little image speaks volumes in terms of the evolution of american racism at least it proportion to wealth hollywood and hollywood marketing am wrong

remember dropping like fifty pounds over maybe five month period remember once was used to the feeling of hunger in way it was motivator knowing would face and overcome that small pain in my stomach throughout the day reveled in eating half meal and leaving the other half for dinner or whatever it became easy after while of course then ended up getting regular girlfriend then wife and over couple of years packed on 40 of those pounds again well half those pounds are muscle now but that's atrophying little bit each day dude--it may seem silly to think about and i'm not saying it's love but pussy is fucking awesome it's going to take you more than four or five months but it's going to happen
whatever fears frustrations or dilemmas you have no matter how great they may seem right now pale in comparison to the vastness of what is only the known universe

replay of deus ex is calling me
love how pointed out this was fake and got voted down people really apparently want to believe they're helping guess
and sure voting me down for saying so certainly makes it more real the the idea of reddit as information exchange not dumping ground for codependents attention seekers pathological liars and disingenuous group hugs but maybe that's just me
don't know why somebody would waste their time trolling because significant chunk of human beings are pathological liars and batshit insane expected reddit to be less gullible

hahaha stupid driver didn't stop momentum on sheet of raw ice heading downhill with his mind dumb driver
grew up in upstate new york there's icy and then there's fucking apocalyptic this was in seattle during particularly nasty ice storm shouldn't be driving but also probably not the worst driver on the planet just west coast driver encountering heavy heavy ice in the video camera social networking age we're all allowed to be geniuses in hindsight
if remember this was the really nasty seattle ice storm that nearly sent city bus over bridge onto the highway below because it hit fast and layered ice everywhere drivers without telekinesis should not be driving
yes please
during this particular storm this is what happened to city busses http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattle911/archives/157478.asp don't think people who are saying drive better idiot necessarily understood how nasty this ice storm was grew up in upstate ny and while some ice is normal this kind of thing is not
bus drivers didn't fare much better http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattle911/archives/157478.asp

look young poor men have been used as cannon fodder for thousands of years by rich white pricks soldiers are not waking up nor are you going to wake them up the solution doesn't rest on educating soldiers the solution rests on building society where there are alternatives for the poor to signing up as mercenaries for fat white bureaucrats
well rich white people start the really big ones make you feel better
your point is made hammered even kind of running over and around the traditional u.s. history of using poor black men as cannon fodder but ok yes people of all colors love to kill people my point remains it's not about waking soldiers up it's more about education and class
as long as you don't act like fucking asshole
oooh yes he's crazy to declare the nation corporatocracy where corporate interests trump the public interest regardless of party is just loopy
blaming nader for eight years of dick cheney is legitimate argument though huh might recommend the documentary an unreasonable man the poor guy like all consumer advocates has been incredibly vilified by deep system of disinformation and idiocy people need to track the last thirty years the rise of the corporate think tank and have broader contextual understanding
in general agree with you appreciate your comments think if they meaning anyone--buddhist christian hindu or muslim were setting up prayer room complete with statues etc and praying out loud in manner others could hear think it would definitely be out of line there are grey area and what level is acceptable definitely depends on the circumstances the culture etc in the case at my work decided don't care--they're not hurting anyone
i've had this happen time to time when my lower back is all out of whack basically the spine pinches the nerves going to the chiropractor has always fixed the issue

since your description of alcoholism describes many people at different parts of their lives--people who may drink normally now or at other times in their past--i can't accept it as description of disease unless the disease comes and goes which most people who are in aa think it does not have been in aa for long time and while find it can be helpful don't think alcoholism is disease and don't think your description makes it one keep coming back
you have the easiest job in the world
you can't discuss symptoms and diagnosis of something that's not disease maybe you could call it condition the wide variety of symptoms people attribute to alcoholism could and do represent whole variety of other stuff the alcoholism one hears described follows no set course has no set symptoms has no triggering mechanism other than drinking apparently--and i'm sure you've met many many who talk about how their alcoholims affects them even when they are not drinking nothing that fits the usual definition of disease you can call it condition if you like--like depression whatever that doesn't make it disease have read the preface of the big book many many times probably hundreds of times that doesn't mean attribute anything scientific to anything dr silkworth said there he was trying to help some messed up drunks but that doesn't mean his ideas were any more than psychobabble agree that alcoholims is defined somewhere as disease the reason for that has more to do with pressure from the cult of aa who basically pushed the recovery industry go ask your gp if he thinks alcoholism is really disease in the end you missed my point--they don't talk about it in aa but there are many many people who acted as you describe yet went on to live long lives not being obsessed with alcohol know quite few i'm not talking about myself i've been sober 14 years next week and still go to aa meetings but that doesn't mean i'm blind to the fact that aa mischaracterizes alcoholism all the time
you started out talking about the definition of an alcoholic later you wrote the amount of alcohol you consume has little to do with diagnosis of alcoholism took the need to diagnose something as an implicit understanding that there was something to be diagnosed that and you used the word alcoholism straying from your starting point where you were defining alcoholic
no
look at all them fancy book stacks he's got probably just for show he doesn't look much like the reading type
shit have there been studies on the immune system response to chimerism that's way cool since hearing about chimerism i've wondered how it could affect so many different things you could probably murder someone leave dna and get off if they took samples for testing from the wrong part of the body wonder if any murderers got off because of this probably pretty unlikely but someday it could come to be you mention above about the million dollar question--unaffected by the hormones of the other set of genes would your brain feel more man or more woman than it does now you may never know if the organ that does your thinking for you is xx or xy and agree it doesn't matter--just interesting but would it work different if not tied in one package affected by those genes and hormones not to mention the artificially introduced hormones thanks for doing the iama totally think that chimerism is the strongest argument to any thinking person that sexuality is totally personal and god were he to exist and be reasonable couldn't have anything to say about who wants to screw what now back to the sex questions--you've had sex with men it seems--when you fantasize are you more likely thinking about straight sex or something different or just being held or what yeah know too personal thanks again

gt if some southerns didn't create this stereotype hundred years ago or whenever this ad would still be made still make sense only no one would give shit rather than some american's chucking spaz not to rain on your parade but if you're trying to claim that this commercial would still exist irrelevant of the history of the american south you may want to look at map of kentucky http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kentucky_in_the_american_civil_war rest assured the history both in regard to racism and cuisine are very much tied together so in summation no this ad would not be the same because kentucky fried chicken would not exist if it hadn't been for some southerners hundred years ago or whenever don't get me wrong i'm not defending the south in any way simply recognizing the fact that its history is inexplicably tied to the products and ideas it birthed furthermore as much as would truly like to believe that australians are innocently unaware of american racial stereotypes i'm beginning to see trend http://www.youtube.com/watch 3y-cxdruyqc link is for an australian ad for chicken treat circa 1992 depicting white australian and an african american

the percentage of guys with bs in engineering making 150 k/year is probably on the order of the percentage of doctors making 150 k/year is probably 92 it's not fair comparison thanks for the link--it was interesting to see the salary averages for the specialties unfortunately agree the money in specialties detracts from the pool of gps my personal opinion though i'm not quite interested enough to see if there's research on this--but i'd read about it if it fell across my lap is that specialization grew out of liability suits from the 70 and 80 everybody expects doctors to be so frickin perfect they are humans subject to mistakes that any mistake is big lawsuit hence specialization--less likely to make mistake if you spend your career studying all the ways the left thumb can turn and charge up the wazoo for your services because you are after all specialist if remember correctly the average md in california was making over 200 k/year as of ten years ago know doctor salaries on average haven't done much in the last 20 years but that's still not peanuts and don't care for the complaints about the cost of medical school compared to the compensation still think it's bs good luck enjoy your career i'm lucky engineer in that while make less than 100 k/year enjoy my work and work in mostly relaxed environment

appreciate your comments and probably should not reply that think seeking to gain respect is more about conceit than it is about being good person if you are good person hard worker then that is its own reward others will notice if you just want to be thought of as good person you want others to see you as good worker does it really matter if you are you will be happy with the illusion don't think in american culture being concerned about what others think of you is necessarily an attribute
oh the downvotes beg translation
it is hard to explain guess just react to the idea that people will complain about lack of respect when don't think respect is necessarily something that's of value people respected hitler people respect many distasteful persons do care if don't have the respect of those who don't analyse well to begin with people who don't share my values
think you're talking about different issue changing your appearance so you're not prejudged is one thing being concerned about gaining respect is another don't know what it's like on the east coast--here in sacramento we have tons of sikh think the largest concentration in the us is just north of here in yuba city i'm sure the percent of social situations you encounter prejudice is function of the local populations familiarity with your culture in my case when see younger sikh with beard and turban usually first wonder if he was born here then listen to his speech and if he's clearly been in the us his whole life immediately wonder if he'll keep the turban or want his son to wear the turban

nope google doesn't want to be national isp they want to create test bed where they can show that the open access model works and where they can test next-generation ads as well as collect data that's useful in debunking lot of the nonsense put forth by incumbent isps
ten years of writing about telecom full time as career every single day that and the fact that google is clearly telling me we're not going to be an isp where do you get yours
that's dude
if it makes you feel any better even with all this craziness i'd still bang her
yeah dude it's my fault for not traveling to china in the 18 years ive been on earth and should be more sensitive to the fact that my math professor is nt understandable and should learn to understand his grammar i'm definately the problem
actually you said bullshit when told you what was actually going on now you're assuming i'm simply taking google claims at face value while giving me lessons in journalism for whatever reason that's odd and borderline asinine but whatever it's the internet google simply wants test bed where they can collect data to use in the policy arena highlighting how the open access model could work they'll deploy the core fiber to the home network then they plan to have other isps come in and compete on top of that network to actually serve support and bill the end user google gets the added perk of testing next-generation video-based services and ad delivery they get yet another bonus of an ocean of data on congestion and network usage data that the mega-isps traditionally never release the move's mostly about testing future video ad technology while gathering statistical ammunition for lobbying and policy they are absolutely hated by carriers like at&amp and verizon it's unlikely they want to shell out the multiple dozens of billions for national hugely expensive ftth network being an isp is hard business because it's utterly dominated by few very powerful players and know google would rather that somebody else build that network
http://gigaom.com/2010/02/10/google-doesnt-want-to-be-an-isp-it-wants-to-be-a-rabble-rouser we are not planning to roll out nationwide isp network this is test bed for innovation
competitive isp is not high margin who the fuck says well it is if you're verizon and you've been pampered for generations by government have monopoly in many markets and repeatedly get endless subsidies and tax breaks for doing nothing building last mile national ftth home network is certainly not high margin in fact with the way that incumbent carriers like at&amp verizon and comcast have government under their thumb it might even be suicide mission

there is absolutely nothing law dmca provision or otherwise requiring that an isp disconnect users for copyright infringement meanwhile many isps will threaten user with account disconnection but haven't actually disconnected any users verizon is good example of this the whole process is rotten there's no objective verification of guilt and the punishment of internet disconnection far exceeds the crime of downloading some tv episodes
yes and you also have the right to get sued when you incorrectly threaten someone's internet connection when they didn't do anything wrong http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-10444879-261.html
like that you see the entire picture that's refreshing personally see huge problems with the fact there's no independent oversight of these disconnection threats http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-10444879-261.html
unfortunately many users only have the choice of one isp
cox was actually one of the first isps in the country to voluntarily agree to disconnect users from the internet after receiving repeated dmca warnings targeting single user...though think it takes multiple warnings

what moronic parent leaves child that young alone with doctor let alone of the opposite sex
heh probably me troll edit typo
thanks
yeah but still most doctors make parents stay or at least bring nurse in due to false lawsuits and what not so any doctor okay insisting on seeing your little one alone should be raising flags
would you feel more comfortable leaving your little girl alone with female doctor or male doctor know abuse can come from either gender but it's just natural instinct to be little more cautious leaving your infant alone with doctor of the opposite sex especially girl with guy that looks like him
gt know abuse can come from either gender

at months you'll get your first panic attack as the genetically modified tobacco still plays racketball with your brain and unless you begin seriously exercising you'll chew your own arm off
absolutely had to counter my quit with serious exercise found my anxiety levels went through the roof something wasn't prepared for even 6-8 months after quitting i've quit three times and the last one has stuck for years or so honestly found don't approach normal until about one year after my quit but i'm sure everybody is different once the quit hits certain point you really will need to help it along with exercise and at least some basic diet changes less sugar to help your body along
and to some the notion of evolution is just as ridiculous you can still respect others beliefs no one can be sure what's true until we fond out when we're dead i'm too stubborn to be convinced there's no god and you're probably just as stubborn as am attacking religion online isn't going to do anything except piss people off
i'm christian and believe in creationism with bit of natural selection and even think it's ignorant to believe that we're the only planet with life the universe is as big and old as fuck hate when people are overly fundamentalist and make more sensical christians look bad some of us do have common sense

reddit.com also where people's usernames are looked at only when brought to your attention edit but in answer to the bait just want to see his ratings tank maybe not the first episode but soon and for the rest of the show's hopefully short span i'm raising awareness to specifically watch other shows tonight if people have nothing else to do
agree with your sentiment and think you're completely right am being cynical but for what it's worth it was ratings that killed conan and ratings which executives used to justify their decision ratings are based on viewership its not the best indicator of show's success so anyone no matter who famous they are except of course nielson family can have an impact on how the network continues from here on out and if we can make small difference why not encourage it

they've tried guess what dozens of states have passed laws in most cases written by companies like at&amp comcast and verizon lawyers and lobbyists that ban them from building their own broadband even in cases where the local incumbent won't the argument is that it's unfair to use taxpayer funds to compete with private industry but the reality is many of these projects are funded with bonds and get banned anyway because carriers don't want competition of any kind
remember mark twain talking about how human beings who were smart quite often failed at business because their intelligence allowed them to see the multitude of possibilities and their creativity often led them down the wrong path or their intelligence and ability to see future angles paralyzed them from making what is sometimes the dumb and impulsive choice think twain failed constantly in business his best quote that can recall all you need in this life is ignorance and confidence then success is sure the older get the more true this seems to be

here's my setup my buddy has 30 mb comcast connection in town connected router dd-wrt but that's not important to his cable modem this router is the heart of everything and provides dhcp for everything for simplicity on his roof have ubiquity bullet-m attached to 21 dbi grid antenna pointing at my house 5.5 miles away we have line of sight this bullet is set in base station mode and is set with an ssid just like any wifi base station at my house have another bullet-m attached to another grid antenna but this bullet is set into client mode and connects to the base station bullet this bullet is then plugged into switch in my basement and that switch then feeds the rest of my network the router back at my buddy's house is the default gateway for the entire network and from network layout the wifi bridge are just more addresses on flat network both bullets are poe so there is just one cat5e run to the roof there is no noticeable added latency as the speed of light over 5.5 miles is negligible the connection has been rock solid staying up even during blizzards and heavy rain it has only gone down once in months and simply power cycling the client bullet fixed it
see above no repeaters were needed have direct line of sight
13 miles will be no problem as long as you can see your target get on the roof with telescope that's what did see above for details about my setup
it was more like 200 for pair of bullets antennas and masts
nothing noticeable there is much more latency between my buddy and comcast than there is between the two of us
the bullet is just wifi basestation or client depending on how it's set up with poe port on one side and an antenna connector on the other
so they got system set up to try to collect money and anyone who doesn't want to pay can easily criticize it because by nature it's an arbitrary system so people who complain often just sound like whiny people because they look for any reason to complain because in the end they just don't want to pay yeah it's not bad system

have not doing that kind of stuff would require lot of autonomy or control over something subtle which is why it seems completely plausible that disney animators may have http://www.subliminal-messaging.com/disney-subliminal-messages
an above the line film/tv producer occasionally we'll work on projects as an ep executive producer but for the most part is pretty much the lead producer on the project we've had success in features and in television an ep title is actually sort of second position to the film's actual producer its given to investors or those involved who were involved in putting it together but not actually involved in the day to day the line producer does the on set work putting together budgets and the teams but the creative producer is the guy who finds the material talent and studio and puts it all together that's what we do
the first season was actually pretty realistic the writers of that show all work in the industry so they were just taking what they knew and putting it on screen take ari gold for example he based completely on ari emanuel his personality is exactly how piven portrays him it was bizarre seeing people work with doing cameos of themselves on screen or when the crew would go to restaurants or bars that me and my friends go to the major difference is that things rarely work as smoothly for anyone as they do for vince and his guys but consider someone like that fairly accurate portrayal of someone initially leaching off of someone success and parlaying that into management career that in reality would eclipse the star success but then again its fiction and everything needs to work out so they change lot of the minor details that make hollywood such hard place to actually make it in
there is sort of complicated system of non-solicitation cannot tell you how many times day writer will cold call us or mail us their script and we always have to turn it down or send it back know you like your script but need proof that its worth my time to read we like many companies in hollywood have non-solicitation policy it's both protection against liability and way to vet good scripts the way we accept scripts is from an agent or manager we work with that way if the script is terrible then we'll know not to trust that manager or agent's tastes again now the question how do get an agent or manager they too usually have non-solicitation policies know its vicious cycle but they'll read your script if you or your script do something to get their attention you can submit your script to the nicholl fellowship http://www.oscars.org/awards/nicholl/index.html which is one of the few respectable screenwriting competitions you can also have someone inside the industry praise your work and send it to managers or agents they know or you could go the long shot route and just send it until someone reads it
for anonymity's sake i'm going to skip this one but if it means anything our biggest film came out in the last five years and made more than 350 million you'd be surprised there's actually lot of surprisingly nice people in the industry but there was studio executive who was behind the lotr trilogy no connection to me who left really good impression on me best day on the job was probably early on in my career when was asked to take look at pile of scripts that came in at the bottom of the pile was this weird thriller that actually really liked so told my boss who had me tell his boss and 24 hours later the script was setup at studio with directors all over town interested in making it here was this 100 or so pages that suddenly became something tangible because saw the potential in it that power was pretty exhilarating and career affirming worst day would probably be back when was working at talent agency had just worked 13 hour day and not feeling well and came in the next day to be yelled at for things well beyond my control as the day went on got sicker and sicker until eventually after working full day excused myself against my boss protests and drove to the er and had emergency surgery that night yes i'd very much like to be in the hot seat pursuing projects that interest me but being producer especially in this economy and the way the industry is going it is all becoming crapshoot you can spend years even decade of your life trying to get movie made and it may never happen
actually haven't had the opportunity to work with lot of big name actors i've briefly met lot of them but its always pleasantries especially when they're just coming in to meet with the boss but there are actors who are famously terrible to work with http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/jun/14/film.features
it's not hard to break in its just hard to move up yes i've worked in the mailroom with mba's and people twice my age your experience and education mean zilch in this town what was your undergrad no what was your agency who was your boss these are the things that people care about pretty much anyone who tries can get into the mailroom its how you control your career after that matters the most who you work for will dictate your path and the opportunities you'll have do want to do this as career but there are days weeks probably months where question whether it's worth it today it is
well it's certainly an interesting life you lead why do you think it would make good hbo show would you see it as scripted series or reality show if it's scripted then the next step is to write down what you think makes your life interesting and what stories you could tell about it right an overall outline and then write out your pilot script if you think reality then you'd need to think of how'd you pitch it what does the average american want to see about your life what happens on regular basis that would make your life interesting taking big love for example it is about polyamory but the real story is about relationships unlikely though they may be and feelings of striking out on your own and being husband how would your story be different
the normal sort of order for the assistant route did is to work in the mailroom of agency and then work as floater to learn the basics then land job on young agents desk and eventually move to big agents desk from there you use your boss's clout or connections to get an assistant job at the studio or at production company do the grinding work and eventually prove yourself able to find good material and sell it you do this until you can strike out on your own and do it for yourself if did decide to leave think i'd want to do something creative but as far from the industry as could get
you figured it out http://www.deadline.com/2010/06/exclusive-paramount-to-make-les-grossman-film-for-tom-cruise
could you be little more specific if you are asking that from cynical perspective meaning that the entertainment industry doesn't produce anything and is therefor an industry built on fake products then i'd say you're right but then again what we are creating is content as our obsession with technology grows it is the content that will be used to fill it personally love movies love being taken away from my reality and taken on an adventure if only for little while love that am part of the machine that makes that and it doesn't matter who you are or what you produce films/tv are always going to be there either to destress you after working long day or to entertain you when you have nothing else to do if you're asking from very childlike perspective to work in an industry where we make imagination come to life i'd say it's very cool the amount of time and effort it takes to turn the written imagination into something visual and real is mind-blowing you can't help but appreciate even the dumbest movies because no matter how terrible they are they're craft they're system of tools used to show you other worlds particularly am in awe of how fx houses are able to create things that lurk in the darkest reaches of our imaginations and respect the writers directors and actors who commit themselves to that idea in order to create these worlds and entertain you for few hours
the majority of my job is sitting at desk making calls responding to emails and scheduling meetings at my busiest deal with about 300-400 emails 200 calls and schedule 20-30 meetings day it sounds stupid but each email each call each meeting may lead to project so its necessary to pursue the rest of my time is spent looking for new material so it means reading lot of scripts and trying to see if any are good enough to attach ourselves to and sell when we're in production my job also has to take on the responsibility of making sure all the above runs smoothly while we are physically on set and knee-deep in day-to-day problems of production anything more specific in mind
in reality lloyd would have already been an agent years ago he worked for the head of the company did his time but for some reason he's sort of in this suspended place because the audience loves him as the assistant so yes did what lloyd did but i've moved on to the next step however if lloyd were real person he'd be doing much better than me i'm still an assistant but yes ari lloyd and are probably the most accurate representation of entertainment people on that show
i'm not defending i'm curious what about the industry do you see as an outdated dinosaur and why do you think it won't adapt those amateurs are always going to be lured by the thought of more production value and there's always going to be someone willing to finance that production value as long as they have way of making their money back either through internet distribution dvd sales or other
do you think it will feel like cruise is just desperate to win back the hearts of people that he's willing to run funny joke into the ground no
sadly it's still in development and probably will never see the light of day but blame that on my boss at the time feel like if it had been me would have been stronger about getting it made but it taught me that its all possible just need to keep looking for the next great thing but have also read early early versions of scripts and tracked their development and seen the movies they rarely match up to the potential in the script example being stranger than fiction but sometimes they make it work 500 days of summer
there are two sorts of people that producers develop ideas with there are those who are or have the life-rights to crazy/eccentric interesting people the other people we meet with are writers who come in with creative original idea that they want to write or have written while think your life is interesting don't think its specific or original enough for someone to option your life-rights but it sounds like you are very passionate about this idea and think you should write it out think trying to write it may prove to be good exercise in honing what is it that can have the audience relate to you now at the end of the day you may still say your writing is terrible which it may be but then you'd have focus on how you want it to look once you have that that's when you should ask around to see who could help you write it cause as producer's that's what we want we want well written story about this crazy world and then we want to meet you and find out it's all very real

there are lot of reasons for why anyone let alone successful tv actor doesn't make it on the big screen but here are some reason why most tv actors are trying to make it in anyway they can so the prospect of landing gig on pilot is dream then to have that pilot picked up for regular series is dream come true but before they realize it they're already contractually obligated to stay with that show for the run of its series shows shoot for most of the year and take short hiatus so actors try to schedule feature opportunities around those hiatuses however most don't have that much free time so if they wanted to free themselves up for features they would need to break their contract in effect pissing off the very people who helped them succeed it's lose lose sadly there are very few opportunities for television actors to show their range and really impress audiences so they end up getting pigeon-holed into playing particular type of character and those characters are often type-cast to the television screen the truth is its very rare for anyone television or film to break out of character they've been so identified with using bryan cranston as an example he's seasoned television actor who worked for years until finally landing good role on malcolm in the middle and when that finished you bet your ass he tried to make feature career but most people saw him as the goofy dad fortunately someone saw the potential in him to play very against-type character in breaking bad so now that he's shown his range he'll definitely make another go at features both in-between seasons and after the show finally ends but who knows if he'll make it he certainly isn't leading man and he's been on shows for so long that it might difficult to remove him from the character like george clooney rosanne or johnny depp 21 jump street were able to
you gotta pay your dues work hours on little pay to get into the union but once you establish yourself and your network of people who are hiring then there's definite room to succeed particularly if you already know what you're doing when you get out here be it grip electric camera dit i'd check out http://mandy.com as good place to start
don't you think that's an over-simplification as an aspiring filmmaker can go make movie on my cheap camera and put it on youtube and find an audience which as an artist makes me happy but if someone told me could use better camera or actual lights or sound kit why would say no to that my production value will improve the product make will be closer to my initial vision and won't have to comporomise by usuing cheap equipment but in exchange for all this the person who invested in my production wants to advertise on my youtube account why not it's just small-minded to say that the industry is one way and amateur is another and never the two shall meet amateurs want to have the means to become professionals think both sides win when the amateur is given the opportunity and the financier is given the ability to get their money back and the viewer is happy if he feels his money is worth the product he paid for if you feel the price of the content is inflated then i'd agree wholeheartedly but like any economy it is up to the consumer to drive-down the price the fact that people are willing to pay 10-15 bucks pop to watch michael bay movie tells the studios that their product is worth that amount

if you can work in television and not be in la then you're set but if you ever desire to give it shot you can always take what you learn here and go back to nova scotia and be an expert instead of curiosity
had to tineye to find out who that was his face looked familiar cameron bright child actors have tough go but find it hard to begrudge success so i'll let him have it until he single-handedly ruins good movie he's got good talent agent who is working diligently on his behalf so far so good as far as the people who have hired him are concerned
feel free to ask as many as you want i'd say about 70 of sound is done in post-production so movies will have sound crews whose sole job it is to make sure their are no irritating sounds that means turning off the ac while shooting stopping production if plane passes overhead anything but there are always going to be things unheard which is why in post the sound designers will work to remove any sounds like that so i'm surprised it was in final movie perhaps it was directorial choice or perhaps it was just mistake
apparently stand corrected noudahoe can you think of movie that turned out better than the script
appreciate that kind words but you've got to understand this is topic think about lot am believer in non-professionals but having worked in the industry also am aware of how adept they are at finding ways to get movies to people through the internet through ways that they're willing to pay but who knows guess i'm saying don't be too sure about the death of the industry its tenacious beast
