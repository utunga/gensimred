yes they should have gone with live nation from the beginning
you'll want more or less everything temporary backpacker has only better quality good sturdy waterproof tent and solid backpack would also suggest decent shoes but never backpack in anything but sandals xd garbage bags are must they have so many uses and you can throw one over your bag when it rains depending on where you're heading pack appropriate clothes last year was on the road for over months and started with little more than clothes tent headlamp toiletries and notebook picked up stuff that realized needed as moved pack your cash/plastic/passport in super secure place and guard it with your life there are great packs that hang around your neck and you can hide under your shirt never took mine off except for when bathed so not all that often lol also pack photocopies of all your important documents espeically passport in case anything should happen to the originals
45 is little small for hitchhiking you'll need to fit few meals worth of food couple pairs of clothes decent tent sleeping bag sleeping mat etc aim for something in the 60 range anything sold at mountain equipment co-op is great quality check these http://www.mec.ca/ast/shopmec/packs/weekendalpinepacks.jsp where are you planning on hitchhiking i'd recommend train hopping only as last resort if you're stranded you can get in fair bit of trouble for that these days

second this notion
do it mcgill is top notch school in an amazing city have to get there in 30 mins so can't write anything else xd
think you may want something little bigger that looks more like an overnight pack i'd aim for something in the 60 ranger although you could get by with something smaller if you're really regimented with your packing look at the 60 packs on the mountain equipment co-op website they're really good value and crazy rugged did months in europe last summer with about 55 and it was perfect just enough space for tent clothes food sleeping bag mat etc
how old are you when you say you are model for superdry belgium do you mean catalogue model if so would have thought they were all the same accross europe for which team are you playing now what is the thing you believe you are missing to be happy
lol this is my video
well it depends if you're never going to be camping you'd probably be able to manage as you wouldn't have to lug around tent/mat/sleeping bag and pillow but it's your call and now that look at the description it says 4350 cubic inches is the capicty which is 70 if that's true then this pack looks very misleading and is probably in fact too big xd
that's impressive but if you were roadtripping you had the extra space of the car could manage hitching with 45 but with my tent sleeping stuff and micro-stove find 60 is ideal
now here game can play fuck your skyrim

agree with this partially went to private school for the first two years but only because that was the only place to actually get degree in baking and pastry then decided to switch to state school to get another degree in hospitality management which would've been the same degree would've continued onto in the other school but state school is much cheaper

my opinion not even close ended up having an extended period of time during my training where due to medical reasons was unable to fly decided to invest little bit of money in buying x-plane and set of yoke pedals and throttle to fly on my computer at home even only having spent 10 hours in real airplane could tell that my experiences in home simulator were nothing really like flying some of the issues noticed control sensitivity was my biggest issue the controls where overly sensitive when they shouldn't have been at low speeds where in real airplane it would take lot of input in the game would flip the airplane over likewise at higher speeds where only little input would be needed to make the plane behave in the game took more than it should have it didn't seem to vary based on speed you don't have the range of inputs that you do in real airplane take landing for instance if i'm over the runway but unsure about my altitude above it as student this is really easy to do you don't have feel for it just yet can quickly glance out the window and see exactly how far above my wheels are in the game though all you have is what is on screen most sim games don't do good job of simulating things like wind tried to set up crosswind takeoff scenario once and aced it because the wind was constant sure that happens sometimes in the real world but at least here it's usually crosswind that gusts from 5-10 kt my instructor would bitch about them he said he could always tell the students who played flight sim games because they were the ones super focused on the instruments instead of looking out the windscreen so yeah imho do yourself favor and save that money for real actual flying you're gonna need it

know dental hygienist who doesn't floss and thinks it's ridiculous that they have to tell patients to do so it's apparently not that big deal she says that patients who have flossed daily forever have no real difference in terms of oral health than others who never do it also there's certain major mouthwash forget which one that doesn't work at all seriously it's major mouthwash sold everywhere and they teach hygienists in dental school that it doesn't work so don't use it but the general public still buys it

gt what is the cheapest way to fly are some routes/dates cheaper coming from the us corsair is cheap option use kayak.com and maybe look into setting up price alert it's usually cheapest to fly on tuesdays and wednesdays check nearby cities as well sometimes short drive to another airport will save you considerable amount gt how much extra money will need for the 2-3 weeks i'm in france not too much france may be wee bit more expensive here and there but if you stick to budget options the price isn't much more than in north america eating out of supermarkets is good policy gt are frenchmen and parisians really as arrogant about americans and non-french speakers should take french class if already speak spanish will be able to get by as long as you're considerate to their culture and well-mannered you should not experience any hostilities it's your duty to shape their impression of americans so do your fellow american tourists favour as for the language taking french class is good idea regardless of where you're travelling it's always fun to get new language under your belt that being said even if you study intensively between now and july you will probably only be able to get rudimentary understanding of the language nothing wrong with that it will certainly help in this day and age though everywhere in western europe especially paris you'll have no trouble finding people who speak some english if you go to paris with no knowledge of french and only spanish you will recognize plenty of words and you will probably be able to get an idea of what most written things mean and convey basic ideas orally but you won't be able to understand individuals who speak only french anyway that's my cents worth enjoy your trip
definitely get eurail pass for the price it's amazingly good value especially for students and with the global flexi pass you can do whatever you want whenever you want like moving so usually spend 2/3 days in city and then hit the road but that's not for everyone to really get to know city you'll need more than days so it's up to you whether you want to relax more or move more couchsurfing yes it's simply the best thing ever europe is surprisingly small you can get from one country to the next in couple hours so don't dream small eastern europe is heaps cheaper than western europe and also little more wild bulgaria is one of my favourite countries to this day little secret of mine there is cruise agency that operates out of venice's port called minoan lines if you can find them they'll take you to greece for euros if you show them your eurail pass true story

all from this one site they do have some good deals
beware of the confirmation bias
that's great point reservations can be hassle and add extra expenses to the trip however even though they're highly encouraged it's actually optional my friend and eventually stopped making reservations when we realized this we would occasionally find ourselves sitting by the cabin doors when all the seats had been filled but they would always just check our tickets and wish us happy trip nonetheless even in germany we walked on completely booked tgv train with no reservation and with flash of our pass we were off albeit on the floor of the cabin so for really long trips definitely reserve unless you want sore bum but for short ones if you don't mind sitting on your pack you'll save time and money thanks for reminding me about the reservations ubermind
aw really that's such shame but good to know when went they were pretty relaxed about the whole eurail thing really half the time they wouldn't even stamp off days and we'd get few extra ones
this is all so good to know haven't even heard of airasia until now and their prices look great checked out your blog funny stuff but really doubt their service could be bad enough to bother me my usual method of locomotion has been hitchhiking so far so comfort is the last thing on my mind haha
yeah the more read the more realize this
yeah got about 2100 by doing it piece-wise most of the flights are finnair actually unfortunately they don't fly to montreal but they have killer prices between asia and toronto
that sounds amazing you're going to have the time of your life mate
that's the spirit pretty much sums up how feel before every trip there's always doubts and worries floating around your head until you take off and there's no turning back but you just gotta shut all those out and run with it everything always works out and there's something you get from travelling that you can't get anywhere else in life

i'm lucky enough to have bhutanese friend living in thimphu he's inviting my girlfriend and in as guests however this process has been real bureaucratic challenge as the country's foreign affairs are quite underdeveloped we started working with the foreign ministry quite intensively last may and found out we would be allowed in as guests only late november

neither of us knows how much acting out there was so you are just assuming that the acting out should have been handled without corrective action involving the bag will give the benefit of the doubt to the school that they acted appropriately since the article doesn't give me any reason to believe otherwise
just my cents on this the product itself looks really cool as gamer could see it doing well my issue this guy and this company have fallen prey like every other company that thinks their untouchable business is made with good customer service its broken with bad customer service doesn't matter how great the item is you work for public company you represent that company in everything you do especially if your using trademarked material names or services in any correspondence if paul really felt this was product he could stand behind he would have had more respect for the creator and the product he was representing and found different approach if any of us have ever had bad service we don't go back look at sears/kmart they treat their employees like garbage and their customers worse than that now they're failing hardcore bottom line customer service is the key to any situation fire the bad apple do some damage control before the losses spiral and move on if n-control doesn't do that then the end result will be fitting btw used to be manager at sears and my family used to deal with the repair service

by zilch meant no changes for the better there were supplements/practices that i've tried that have produces changes for the worse for example gingko biloba made me feel cloudy and out of it and after exercise tend to feel bit mentally fatigued not the clear centered feeling that seemingly everyone else reports for the record have continued with exercise run 3-4 miles every day or two and do the perfect pushup regime and the after effects of have become noticeably less severe can definitely imagine what would like to feel like the biggest change i'm seeking is an increase in mental clarity at this stage it comes and goes throughout the day based on variety of factors but up until around puberty and subsequent major depressive episode experienced full lucidity just about all the time this went hand-in-hand with more in-the-moment and emotionally intense existence don't wish to be child again but you better believe that desire to live this way again gt think you will find it worthwhile keep log and really try to notice the differences between substances and how they effect you i'm definitely interested in tracking my progress do you have any suggestions for tracking methods/programs i'm the kind of person that'll spend the rest of the day looking for the perfect program and then still not be satisfied with find i'm hoping to find something that has the ability to visually graph the various components of my mental performance over time ease of input and potentially something compatible with an iphone right off the bat i've considered using excel and especially if can find pre-made template i'll probably just go this route gt if you want more suggestions you should state health currently what you are taking diet exercise what if anything makes you happy excited etc what is it you are trying to achieve of all the things you tried what were the biggest successes what were the biggest failures how why i'm guessing this might be better suited for brand new post but very briefly live fairly healthy lifestyle eat well exercise and currently don't take anything except for centrum vitamin and since its cold season emergen-c about once day and occasionally garlic pill to fight cold or the onset of one btw fom one random dude on the internet to another thanks

whoah where did you get the idea advocated putting him in bag because he's autistic my original post advocated putting him bag if he were uncontrollable because of his actions not because of his condition in truth am not an expert in this--and from your posts it does not appear you are either since the people who put him in the bag work in the field i'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they know what they're doing regarding my point is that if the kid is uncontrollable then keep him at home do not think uncontrollable kids have right to excessive attention and services on the taxpayer's dime especially at the expense of the other kids call me hateful if you like have seen kid attack teacher in diabetic rage they had two pe teachers holding this medium sized ninth grader down with difficulty

you're going to have an amazing time i've freecamped all over australia and new zealand and it's wonderful way to save some cash would recommend picking cheap tent at aussie disposals when you get there when you're finished do the altruistic thing and drop it off at salvation army they have cheap one for 35 so it's no big loss if you're willing to spend little more you can get something lot more compact/lightweight and if you pack conservatively the tent won't be any extra trouble even if weren't freecamping i'd keep tent on me just because you never know when you might find yourself without place to sleep as far as gear goes all you really need is compact sleeping bag you could also get an inflatable pillow and foam mat but if you want to save space you can just improvise these with your clothes tiny compact stove is also an option but those add fair bit of weight that being said after weeks of cold food one of those can be wonderful thing anyway hope some of this helps
having taken an exchange to the university of melbourne can say that this would fit almost all your criteria gt want to be close to nature and the beach surfing is not priority but would be cool good national parks nearby would be awesome yup st kilda beach is short tram ride away from the city center and is wonderful spot to soak up the sun unfortunately it's in bay and doesn't have very big surf waves but lots of people surf there anyway gt like nice weather hot unless you're there between may to september the weather will be beautiful nice and hot and you'll avoid the ridiculous and painfully scalding heat of the north brisbane and up gt like good public transportation and would like city where do not have to drive car melbourne's hop-on/hop-off tram service is excellent and paired with an expansive bus and train network there is really not much more you could ask for gt would like to live in city or place with vibrant culture/nightlife and be able to meet other students/people my age relatively easy do not want to feel isolated cannot stress enough how much melbourne would meet these expectations gt would like city/town that has nice accessible surrounding area that would lend itself to weekend and day trips there are also lots of great spots for day trips nearby the great ocean road is right next door as well as kangaroo island french island etc there are also cheap flights all over oz check tiger airways and jetstar melbourne is the only city with direct flights and boats to tasmania in addition to all this melbourne has an outstanding music scene unrivaled culture an extremely laid back atmosphere that nowhere else in oz seemed to rival the people are friendly and welcoming and uni of melbourne is in the top 30 schools worldwide with beautiful campus hope this helps regardless of where you decide to go you'll have fabulous time
they were never problem for me you'll definitely need sleeping bag regardless of whether or not you camp and really lightweight person tent can be as light as 1kg although something that light will be bit more expensive so it's hardly hassle the tent bought in oz for 35 was little cumbersome and heavy but didn't really mind really good one i've been using lately is this one http://www.bronzemoonoutdoors.com.au/online-shop/msr-hubba-v5-tent it's quite expensive but boy will it last and it's only 3lbs and it handles strong winds like nobody's business as for stoves you can get ones for under 50 but the quality will suffer use this one http://www.mec.ca/ast/shopmec/memberpicks/hikingcamping/prd 4017-310 primus-himalaya-omnifuel-stove.jsp but it's totally your call neither of the ones i've showed you are ones your going to want to ditch as they are excellent quality it's ultimately gonna come down to whether or not you want something little more expensive that will last you while or something cheap that you can toss when you leave oz seeing as you're going for over year something more expensive and durable might be worth the extra and you'll be able to bring it back with you when you're finished hopefully
hey awesome advice thanks so much think i'll definitely give all of those routes of inquiry serious look i'm familiar-ish with mindfulness meditation but the sedona method and nlp are new to me quick wiki search and scan through makes nlp sound little iffy though but i'll continue reading on do you have any personal or otherwise experience with any of these approaches i'd love to hear about some first-hand accounts very motivating
the footprint isn't really necessary as the bottom of the tent is waterproof durable and quite easily repaired you could even make one out of some tarp for fraction of the price for the tent one thing i'll suggest is getting the people version actually have the people version of the one sent you just grabbed the link before the extra space is certainly luxury but it's so great to be able to spread out your stuff and not be super cramped plus if you ever end up travelling with friend you'll be set here's an exact model of the one have http://www.backpackinglight.com.au/prod313.htm i've used it in heaps of countries and it's done amazingly plus it's only 1.8 kg while the person one is 1.4 kg so say the extra space for that tiny weight difference is worth it as for the stove it's definitely not necessary in fact if i'm planning on doing lots of hiking/tramping in trip don't bother with it and it is bit of hassle to set it up but that being said it is nice to have when was in oz and nz didn't bring it along mainly because was using cheaper heavier tent and didn't have much extra space you also have to bring cooking pot with you and hate doing dishes lol but on shorter hitchhiking trips usually bring it regarding the weight don't be too intimidated if you have good backpack that distributes weight on your hips properly you'll be amazed at how much you can comfortably carry my girlfriend is about your weight 22 yo and she manages fine with full 60 bag it might be tough for the first little bit but you get strong fast
all cities have excellent public transport as for moving between cities the distances are quite large and often it's actually cheaper to fly check jetstar and tigerairways for the best prices another awesome fun and about as budget as you can get option is hitchhiking before you bash it keep in mind that it's incredibly stigmatized by the media and is actually way safer than you may think check here http://www.outback-australia-travel-secrets.com/hitchhiking-in-australia.html and here http://hitchwiki.org/en/australia i've met some of the most genuine people of my life while hitching and i've never had bad experience
ran into the the notion of magnesium deficiency little while back and followed up on it with blood test at my university health clinic according to how the doctor interpreted the results all of my levels were fine including iron which understand to likewise be cause for these kinds of symptoms so never actually tried taking mg quick search shows that its pretty cheap though so maybe i'll just give it shot also i'm going to try get my hands on those results because from what i've read in other posts docs don't always have the most up-to-date information on what're considered normal levels

oh awesome love it any particular places in buckhead you'd recommend
good call here for place to meet up/grab drink anything worthwhile nearby though
redtop mountain is gorgeous and friday is supposed to be quite nice out too unfortunately i'm not sure how comfortable am with that long of drive for our first date/time meeting in person we met on dating site that drive could be little uncomfortable maybe for some time down the road though outdoorsy-lite is probably more akin to what i'm aiming for here know there used to be tavern/bar on one corner of the park by 10 th and monroe but have never actually been any idea if its worthwhile also anywhere in the vicinity you'd suggest strolling over to
stone mountain park is fantastic was just there not too long ago great suggestion i'm looking for minimum of driving so the brewery is probably out what about the old brewery though i've never heard of this
i've been there and not exactly my cup of tin mean tea anything that doesn't feel so much like bar is more up my alley in fact speaking of tea really cool coffee shop or tea house would be awesome and this isn't limited to the buckhead area either
never been to redbrick this might be fun and of course kennesaw mountain is great too only problem is that it might be little far out for this particular occasion
here in california our large flood control projects are financed by the state because no private entity would have drummed up the cash to build the facilities in the end the costs are spread over those who directly benefit it's not perfect and depending on the scope or scale perhaps private entities can do these things but to now this has been working for us fairly well it's getting more complicated with the environmental regulations but that's the nature of the business

resume should be sent in the format that the job posting requests it in at previous job where assisted in the hiring process this was back in 2004 or so we had very specific requirements in the job posting as to how the applicant was supposed to send us resume plain ascii text in the body of the email contact information at the top with no cover letter and no attachments this was clearly specified in at least three places in every job posting we made the reasoning was that if an applicant could not follow simple clearly spelled out instructions that means that they did not accurately read the job description and probably would not be good employee would you believe more than 50 of people who would apply for position could not follow those directions of those most just attached doc file some would do both paste the contents into the email and attach files it was quick way to narrow down the applicant pool the ones who followed directions were the ones that got closer looks now if the job posting doesn't specify what to send it in send it in the absolutely most os-agnostic format you can pdfs are good tl dr follow directions and send what the posting asks for if they do and bring nicely formatted one to the interview if they don't pdfs are fine
this place looks awesome cool suggestion but damn 30 for high tea worth it

been kinda busy lately so i'm only getting the chance to respond to this now you say gt i'd steer clear of it as you can't jack your blood levels quickly with that delivery method is this something that is desirable out of magnesium supplement to jack your blood levels quickly that seems unusual i'm basically just taking it to either confirm or discount the possibility of mg deficiency as the source of number of depression-type symptoms that i've been experiencing for while i'm going to give it approximately 4-5 weeks and if experience no changes then plan on stopping after all applying mg oil to the bottom of the feet is pretty awkward and messy process otherwise do maintain relatively healthy diet so don't think want to spike my levels to that much more than the 400 mg rda for males yes you guess correctly speaking of which how much do you take/day it sounds like you're probably getting quite lot and if may ask what are you taking it for and do you find it works

1st of all...never said was atheist 2nd yeah believe what you will but the belief that an almighty diety would choose to help an egotist like tebow is offensive and ignorant not to mention that it goes against everything jesus taught everytime he takes knee and thanks his lord and saviour he is flaunting what he thinks is his moral superiority worship whoever however you want but keep it where it belongs
she works at chicken express
think have to agree
and yet you cared enough to leave comment
ok...here it is for all of you that cant read the rest of the post...not an atheist do believe very much in god do not believe that he interferes with daily lives...if he did assure you he would not choose football as the medium of proof
about years ago was watching my dogs go poop in the back yard it was about 11 pm and black outside there was porch light on in the back by the door there is pool pump system on the side of the house and there is no light there i'm setting the scene so i'm in the backyard and look over to the pool pump area you know how there are shadows within shadows well what saw was shadow myst fuzzy moving cloud in the shape of man he must have been feet tall his back was turned and he had robe with rood on he turns his head to reveal even darker shade of pitch blackness where his face would be had never been so afraid in my life he vanished when blinked but this lasted for good seconds

sorry...not flaming anyone or trolling by posting this thought the nfl community would at least share laugh at this at the very least agree with the frustration of lot of people that tebow and tebowing is painful at best enjoy watching good game and last sunday's game was one of the best but to see him take knee and pray ruins the point of the game it was/is about team work and to see him do this everytime undermines the other players that was my point and honestly thought the nfl community would see that
its not just the praying in public every interview he does he first thanks his lord and saviour and then if there is time he may work in the conversation the effort of his teammates as to the fact of his interventions well that is better left in different thread
you are right but did become national craze the 1st time they did it tebow is seriously over rated he has no passing game personally the rest of the team deserves more credit than he does the man has marketed himself into oblivion and dont agree with the way he did it
actually in denver at the start of the season he was in every third commercial during game not so much since he's been playing gatorade had field day with him or least the stations out here did
if he can do it again then the argument is invalid right now he won lost most of which were because of bad throws and stupid turnovers and they almost blew 20 point lead on sunday the defense wasnt playing good either at that time as to the children's hospital thats in the phillipines and that is commendable it is very much needed in that country
how it feels to be in canada http://imgur.com/sqjhb

that it will
sorry not huge on stats thank you for correcting me meant say he won in row and lost in row

xenogears
agree bought parasite eve just to play the demo of xenogears it's shame xenosaga did not live up to my expectations set by xenogears
yes wish they made another game like it played mother and it was very good but no where as good as earthbound...in fact now have the onett theme stuck in my head
don't think the game time has been decided just yet according to the site i'm on phone so couldn't do ton of exploration bought ticket using terminal located in 7-11 few days before the game think you can get it in english if remember correctly almost years ago now otherwise i'm not too sure how to go about it against yakult early in the season bet you can get tickets day or two ahead maybe even day of in the 3rd or 1st baseline bleachers at least public transportation is easy it's single line from umeda station if i'm not mistaken took it to and fro with no difficulty get some fuusen balloons as you walk into the stadium and join in the fun of the 7th inning stretch
we still use steam plants eh of has one most old hospitals have one maybe it was one of them
was just reminded on group who meet up in an elevator and would just chill out in there and people got on whenever just through it would be fun to have reddit take over bus monocle and memes abound
power plants do use steam but i've never heard somonebwith call powerful plant steam plant but times do change
yeah that's how all refrigerated vehicles work on semi-trucks the unit is on the front of the trailer
yeah unfortunately when you move from out-of-state the only place you can get license is at the main dmv office and there's only one for the whole county so you're kinda screwed there my wife moved here from tennessee and had to go there but her wait was only about hours fortunately you only have to do that once though once you've got an al license and tags you can go to the satellite offices or better the courthouse for renewals as for where to live it kind of depends on what kind of person you are if you have family usually recommend madison as it's mostly families and kids if you're single five points but imho pick the place closest to your place of work areas usually recommend people moving here avoid old madison pike between the space center and 255 research park blvd and bridge street areas immediately north of uah roughly bounded by sparkman jordan university most of holmes ave but especially between jordan and downtown pretty much all of north huntsville though hear some of the areas closer to downtown are getting nicer areas off bob wallace between triana and memorial parkway
super mario bros hahaha just kidding
dont think we needed this poll to figure that out
unfortunately huntsville's downtown kinda sucks it's mostly banks and law offices all of which clear out at 5pm so there's not lot of life in the evenings and weekends having said that things are improving and are lot better than when moved here in 2005 there are few bars downtown amendment xxi comes to mind sammy t's is there if you like music too as it crossroads and few decent restaurants sam and greg's and pane vino both have some of the best pizza in town and james steakhouse is amazing but so is the bill they're also starting to redevelop parts of downtown belk hudson lofts are currently under construction http://www.belkhudsonlofts.com and they're supposed to be re-developing councill courts http://huntsvilledevelopment.blogspot.com/2011/07/councill-court-whats-ahead.html so things are headed in the right direction but are not really there yet
do you know what building you'll be in or where it's located boeing has facilities all over town from the airport to research park to iirc some place on the parkway and on the arsenal as well
thought about it some more this morning here are few more places i'd recommend avoiding square roughly bounded by patton rd bob wallace memorial parkway and drake ave but extending bit south from drake golf rd and the vicinity governor's drive between memorial parkway and i-565 and it's environs although lowe mill is in that area
i'm actually not hipster in real life i'm more of hippie was going to go with physicshippie but it didn't sound right to me so used the word hipster which is where the word hippie was derived from there more you know

paying for stuff some banks have special account that allows infinite overseas withdrawals look into getting one and also be sure to let your bank know you will be travelling as they may otherwise freeze your account when they see money being taken out oversees driver's licence depends on how you plan on travelling the country has dirt cheap flights and hitchhiking is amazingly easy most cities have excellent public transportation as well so it's really up to you camping no harm in bringing your own gear and saving some money but if you forget anything look into visiting an aussie disposals store they have dirt cheap and good quality gear and can be found all over oz packing space 90 is plenty of space spent months down under living out of 60 bag keep in mind you'll no doubt have lots of stuff you'll want to bring back in the end so don't overpack power most electronics today especially cameras and laptops will handle any voltage without any problem you should be fine with just your outlet converter phone can't help you with this as didn't use cell well travelling but look into getting magic jack for calling back home it's cheap little device that allows you to plug phone into your computer and gives you unlimited calls to city of your choice from anywhere in the world for small monthly fee it was great especially when needed to talk to someone who wasn't online happy travels

you must have never had wedding my wife and had what consider to be pretty low-key wedding but the costs still add up fast first there's the wedding tax when you mention the word wedding the cost of nearly everything goes up about 30 then the marriage license invitations and stationary mailing djs facility rental for the reception catering alcohol and corkage fees cakes cake cutting fees flowers photographer expenses for the bridesmaids and groomsmen tux rental transportation hotel the list goes on like crazy we did every possible thing we could to trim costs we kept the guest list to reasonable number got married in church no cost though it's traditional to tip the priest her wedding dress was under 500 we printed our own invitations and programs on wedding stationary we bought at target we handled our own mailing and encouraged people to rsvp online and thus didn't include return postage we provided our own alcohol for the reception and our own catering at the church guess what the cost of our low key wedding was still nearly 10 and that doesn't include the nearly 5k dropped on the honeymoon each one of these things in and of themselves is relatively cheap but they add up hardcore my budget no shit was like pages in small type in excel and again our wedding was low key compared to every other one we've been to have no doubt that at least one wedding went to the person probably dropped 50 on hell just having service do our invitations rather than us doing them would have been an additional 2k when having wedding it is very very easy to cross 15

at some reception venues if you don't use their catering service for the cake they charge you fee for cutting the cake it also covers the person standing there serving the dishes and such and boxing up the remaining cake in our case it was so much to get the cake made through their caterer that it was cheaper to use our baker and just pay the cutting fee iirc it was about 200

hey dude i'm also backpacking from japan to india next summer and i'm canadian too ha i've looked all over for the best flights and done heaps of research and this is what i've found for next june/july so prices in march would probably be very similar if not cheaper japan gt continental asia fukuoka gt hanoi for 360 cad one way with china southern airlines japan gt australia osaka gt perth for 450 cad round with air asia i've also found some decent airfares about 400 between korea and japan but forget which airline if you don't get these prices let me know and i'll see if can find them again mainly use kayak.com but note that it doesn't search air asia flights if could suggest decent route don't know how much time you have but you could probably do this in little over month vancouver gt tokyo gt osaka gt perth gt melbourne gt india gt southeast asia gt vancouver anyway that's just what do hope this helps cheers
