ok favorite movie that you would think had an amazing script
honestly....yeah if dialogue scares you then right it out without as for the script you can beat out the story in three acts set up scenes without dialogue and then fill in the blanks last
ha don't know him sorry but if you've ever been fan of that 70 show you might want to check this out http://www.harpers.org/archive/2002/03/0079095 as for american beauty alan ball vs judd apatow it's completely different alan ball is genius so i'm willing to bet the execution of that movie was pretty close to his intention with judd it is lot of ad-libbing...a lot doubt the original script in anyway resembles the final product but they both end up work suppose
unfortunately we deal very little with music can tell you that executives at studios/networks who sole job it is to licence and use music for various films but i've never worked that side of things but joe escalante former punk rocker for the vandals now entertainment attorney hosts radioshow dedicated to these kind of questions and i'm pretty sure they have library of past questions that might help you out http://barelylegalradio.com/site if you can't find the answer there you can always call in
from what know of my contacts who do that its just matter of rummaging through the countless cds they get sent and tracking the popularity of new albums i'm sure there is an art to it the way music managers have relationships with the music execs has got to be the way literary managers know development execs
assuming you aren't steven spielberg jj abrams or about handful of other mega-successful creators then you'll have to go through some variation of the following have sample something that people will read and think you'd be able to execute an idea pitch an idea to producer who has already read your sample and knows you can execute goto studio/network with that producer and pitch your idea they'll look at your sample and gauge whether they like the idea enough to pursue if you get the go ahead you'll be given window to write out your idea the producer will give notes and so will the studio/network eventually they'll either greenlight your idea kill it or give it to someone else to write as director it's similar but little different you'd generally have the script already and pitch your version of it and how you are going to make it different then they the studio could have imagined it it's never the case of non-megatalent non-writer coming into the studio and pitching them an idea they'd still need to find the writer and expect you to have done the bulk of the packaging work to some capacity
not my area of expertise but gotta assume that's still true artists have always gotten fucked over by their labels thank god for indie labels and thank god for touring right
i'm certainly intrigued what made you put this together what's your background feel free to pm me if you prefer
just splitting hairs music producer is different than music label that being said completely agree with you think the best model for new musicians is to go out and play shows selling your product directly to the consumer use the internet to get notariety but don't expect your sales to becoming from record stores any more the times have changed
love primer had no idea he wrote new script thought he famously did everything for primer directed starred did the music but once it was done went back to engineering i'm going to have to track that script down
agreed but i've been doing it so long it actually feels like learned language to me like ceremonial dance we all have to do and have mastered email has definitely changed things what's really amazing is how many conversations it takes to get anywhere on project you still working the industry
all good opened the door just know relatively little about music compared to other aspects of the industry
sadly we have pool of unpaid interns but i'll keep you in mind should we get money for readers you in la
its tough for sure the though that you would spend time and energy on something that is meaningless to anyone but you but if you don't do it then why do you want to be writer if you believe in that as career you need to able to write for yourself and hope that through practice someone else would like it to the job on set transition to writer's assistant isn't exactly how it goes you want to get job as writer's pa and yes those jobs are hard to get if you haven't gotten it from anyone else can fwd you the latest uta joblist although that's more for development jobs then production if you want it just pm me your email and i'll fwd
ahh my advice stay up there as long as you can know there aren't as many film/tv opportunities up there but man its worth trying to make it happen cause la is not great city
works for me
ha the idea of grips being fit is hilarious but do get jealous of someone being on set and physically doing something with their hands hate sitting at desk all day
when think of grip think of an old bearded grizzled mofo
haha i've seen him do a's at the room many times he is amazing and i've actually heard story from writer who met him once before anyone knew what the room was
in perfect world manager or someone would have seen the video and contacted you already what you should do is write full script and/or series bible based on your animation and see if you can get some more buzz with second video or something to that extent unless you're concerned its one hit wonder
difficult to say you could make the argument that recently at least since that article has come out there has been steady slew of counter examples juno baby momma friends with benefits ivan reitman's new movie however i'm not going to easily dismiss the sexism jennifer's got very particular viewpoint that i'm sure has been reinforced by examples in her life for our company specifically we do gear towards the male demo that's not to say we'll throw out script that does otherwise basically the most important thing is good original story secondary thoughts are who is the audience will people pay to see this etc etc some female-centered stories may not pass those secondary concerns but at the very least it'll get that writer noticed there are female executives and producers at every level of development but wouldn't be surprised if there was still an affinity towards male-centric movies even for female producers/execs
write script always because if you just shoot small pilot and its good they'll bring you in and say okay what do you have and you'll stare at them and point the the pilot you want to have the next thing ready so write the script first then shoot the short version of it so that when they bring you in you have something to show
there is rampant abuse of free labor in our industry but that's how it goes everyone does unpaid internships at the start of their career and everyone uses them on one side it is way in on the other it's hard work for no pay
again most actors are actually professionals there are few exceptions of course we once had to fire crew member for supposedly making talent feel uncomfortable after getting this person approved through countless steps and flying this person out to location ended up only working week sometimes i've always been particularly harsh critic of movies sometimes knowing the background behind how movie got made can make the film appear less professional but by far the thing find most annoying is how terribly written most movies are used to be far more accommodating not anymore yes but not too often it's not an ethical thing its laziness thing i'm fortunate to live in los angeles so that bands want to see almost always come through here and feel that by paying for their shows/merchandise justify downloading their mp3s as for movies i'm such stickler for the theater experience that rarely watch movies on my computer or even on my tv unless have no other options the majority of the top brass of the industry doesn't care how you watch their content they just don't want someone else profiting cast and crew couldn't give shit they got paid it's worth noting that despite pirating the economic crisis and series of union strikes this has actually been financially successful year for the film industry go figure
think maybe you're trolling because this seems little too extreme but ok low libido could be anything total refusal to engage in any sexual activity is indication of abuse if you love him you'll suggest he get counseling if he doesn't after repeated attempts go find somebody less fucked up
fake but humorous
felt bad about leaving my ex-wife at least in part over lack of sex good friend told me you didn't leave because of lack of sex you left because of lack of intimacy didn't believe her until she asked would you have left her if she had an accident or something and was no longer able to have sex immediately said no surprising even myself my friend was right left because of lack of intimacy

well it went beyond that in the fact that the website admins essentially told users who use adblock to leave and that they created no value for the website that's great telling your userbase that you only create value for the site if you contribute to ad income ignoring the fact that they contribute value simply by being part of the community and talking or sharing links elsewhere ars does some good work but there is some jackassery there
don't forget value is subjective while you may see value in community as does reddit bigger sites like ars may not be able to afford that luxury it's not really choice your userbase creates value through participation the value of reddit is in its users because the users contribute all the content and at site like ars they push ars content they contribute insight to comments and they shape the direction of the website through recommendations to provide good content one must have good writers who research the subjects provide unbiased analyses and do so in professional manner the people capable of providing said content likely want to get paid therefore in the eyes of ars value is in revenue not simply views because views won't keep the site afloat it's not to say ad revenue isn't important but again users who use adblock still contribute to the site's value and revenues through participation and recommendation some of ars staff comments during that whole kerfuffle were insulting and obnoxious besides ars has no role in dictating how users use their browsers and if they can't profit without telling their users they don't offer value if they don't click on ads maybe ars should find another business model
read mike masnick at techdirt's take on that whole ars ad thing think it explains why ars was wrong in great detail http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100306/1649198451.shtml
it amazes me the number of people here who are misequating 15 with the value of an investment of 15 in this company is to this judge regardless how this judge ruled it wasn't going to make substantial difference to his bottom line/net worth/income rule one way and his 15 may go up to 17 k--or down to 13 k. who here thinks two thousand dollars is how much this judge values his job because that's what you're saying--he's dumb enough to risk his job over the profit or loss in this particular investment and it has nothing to do with the value to someone who has no money--this judge certainly has more than that
i'm guessing that for much of pre-history the treatment you received growing up would have been pretty common if that's true were they as fucked up as you or do you have issues related to the stigma of having been victim of sexual abuse/incest or are you just fucked up because you couldn't trust anyone i'm guessing contact with penis in and of itself wasn't actually harmful--it was the lack of control the feelings associated comment
thanks for response your long term emotional pain and fucked-up-edness has little to do with getting ass-raped in my opinion i'm sure it hurt but no more than when caught yard dart in my head as kid i'm not fucked up about that today--the damage isn't due to the pain no stigma you never ever worry about how that knowledge might affect how others view you would tend to think it might be common to fear that others might misunderstand what had happened leading you to not want to talk about it i'm not saying it's something that needs to come up all the time but i'm guessing there are times when it could come up that you avoid the subject hey correct me if i'm wrong think it's more likely that in prehistory the receivers of abuse just passed it on the those weaker later on when they had some power no point in getting your ass kicked again by someone who might still be bigger than you easier to just do what you want to the next generation might be troll i've known plenty of screwed up people who were subject to abuse as children one who suffered far worse than you'll know and she's more screwed up that just about anyone know i'm not going to appear too sympathetic to your plight--i don't think it's going to help anything if anything think you're doing the right thing talking about it--it doesn't need to be that big fucking deal though you may never trust anyone ever good luck
mike holmes holmes on homes
i'm not saying your problems are petty just human was just lucky my older brother who was fairly fucked up individual never got any more cruel than he did definitely had some emotional scarring but there's no way to determine how much my issues were related directly to him--and it doesn't matter now know the newer studies show recovery from post traumatic stress syndrome which is probably pretty much what you have is easier if one mentally goes back through the stressful situation and becomes more comfortable with the memory rather than stuffing it down of course many who have such horrible memories don't want to relive think there probably is something powerful in being able to realize the things we go through are just things we go through guess i'm just saying that because don't want to act like you getting raped by your brother needs to be something that haunts you think it's the social stigma in western society that keeps people from getting over the horrors of those types of things because they can't talk about them again not that you want to just that being able to might make it easier ah good luck
built my security system around ge simon xt the simon xt is the base station and you can just add on wireless sensors wherever you need them like door and window sensors glass break sensors motion smoke detectors ect the reason went with the simon was that it could be used as stand-alone unmonitored system or you can add gsm card and have it monitored by central dispatch currently have mine monitored by alarm.com which also gives me full control over the system thru my iphone bought my system piece by piece used on ebay for few hundred
haven't had battery go dead yet and i've had the system installed for almost years the monitoring thru alarm.com is actually resold by company called safemart.com my total is 31 per month but have their advanced plan this allows the system to text me when certain events happen like if my parents disarm the system to feed my dog and it will text me if the system isn't armed by certain time during certain days http://www.safemart.com/livewatch.htm had adt at my previous house and this setup is leaps and bounds better in every way and cheaper to boot
think his point that you're willfully ignoring is that hate is far different from derogatory sure they're both negative but to call anything that is any shade of negative hate speech is to get into the zero tolerance area which is not useful that's why we have 18 year olds on the sex registry because of this zero tolerance bullshit you are perpetuating quit exaggerating
the word dyke is spelled d-y-k-e this alone dispells your argument the words alone are not derogatory it's only your interpretation of their use i'm with the people who say you're being too sensitive
maybe you're being downvoted for being dumb-ass everyone knows that the romans killed jesus to say the jews killed jesus because some local politicians/religious leaders may have conspired to have jesus sent to the romans where he was so stupid he let himself be crucified--it's pretty dumb broad and inaccurate generalization
the jews are not represented by few local religious leaders who once upon time sent jesus to the romans those local religious leaders are not the jews am contradicting what you refer to as the jews sending jesus to the romans is not the same as killing him the romans could have set jesus free if the romans had set jesus free would you be saying the jews set jesus free if the romans had whipped jesus would you be saying the jews whipped jesus i'd say no and no the local religious leaders sent jesus to the romans who killed him it doesn't amount to the same thing when first read my first response to you thought was rude and almost apologized after thinking second longer think was right and what you say is more along the lines of unnecessarily race baiting than characterizing what the jews did
and in 2000 years it will be the americans who killed martin luther king because couple of people were up for it and few of their supporters were concentrated in the surrounding area disregard that the 50 of the people who supported him and the other 25 of the people who didn't care weren't concentrated in that area the jewish religious leaders of that time didn't then and don't now represent the jews most jews then and today didn't give shit who jesus was jesus was killed by romans possibly at the behest of few local religious leaders
what can we do guess if we're going to be interested in representing the truth we shouldn't go out of our way to write elaborate explanations about how when someone says it was the jews that what they said was technically correct especially when it wasn't
you wrote it was the will and actions of the jewish religious leaders that directly lead to his death why didn't you just say it was the actions of jesus turning shit upside down that caused the local religious leaders to take him to the romans which directly lead to his death you are choosing the starting point artificially to put the cause at the feet of some jews in response to some guy saying it was the jews who killed jesus maybe we're picking nits but think that your original response gives the idea that the jews did it pass when it's bs those bs ideas were used in the past to kill many jews no i'm not jew or christian
i'd say the active role was done by the guy with the hammer jesus if he had half brain would have known the romans weren't going to put up with any shit on big holiday weekend in the center of commerce considering why he was probably actually killed as opposed to the conflicting crap written in that book he should have figured he was going to get killed the romans didn't play around
and random us history trivia before the game you'd have to answer series of questions to test whether you were 18 at least at the time of it's release 1987 but in retrospect doubt i'd even know the answers to them if was 18 this was all pre-internet so you'd just guess until you got it right and you'd need to get certain number in row to actually play otherwise you'd get booted out and have to start again and there was maybe pool of 30 questions to answer so by the time was knew lot of random facts tiptoe through the tulips was recorded by tiny tim and the last name of annette on the mickey mouse club was funicello fuck loved that game

don't pay anyone to edit if you are confident in your writing then that should be good enough if you're not take couple weeks off and re-read fresh the majority of scriptwriting contests are scams there are only few exceptions such as http://www.oscars.org/awards/nicholl/index.html it is an uphill battle if you are outside of the system its hard to get in if you know anyone inside the industry its time to bug them they'll probably hate you for it but they'll be your best shot long shot but can work go shoot one of your scripts or short based on your script submit that to festivals and when you get chance to meet with producers/managers ect you can tell and send them all your screenplays best of luck

you have to understand that to blogger slow news day is the equivalent of walking up to someone at cafe climbing up on their table squatting and shitting in their coffee it's maybe worse given it happens so often and is so redundant kind of like the kardashians that bloggers and mods tend to over-react to it many mods just delete those comments because they're useless if you don't like story move the fuck on that said agree that banning people for it is jackassery and banning you in particular was particularly particular form of jackassery

i'd like to refi rental property but am going through short sale on primary principle residence or i'd like to buy new cheaper residence if put enough down can get any kind of loan haven't made payment on 1st or 2nd for this house for 18 months in case there were any straws to grasp
on my short sale the buyer's financing fell apart recently in this manner his dti is pretty high over 50 but when you add in the future rental income they were taking it i'm told it was chase buyer's credit is very good buyer had offered 85 only offer was listed at 120 but my bank wanted 98 based on their bpo buyer finally agreed to 98 because he really wants the place there are comps over 100 in area and appraisal came in at 100 k. but apparently fannie requires desk reviews of some percent of all loans now so some guy out of state reviewed the appraisal and said it was only worth 90 based on some incomplete info on the appraisal my agent and the loan broker say there's no recourse to desk review--you can't contact them to answer their questions on the loan so the deal died the buyer has to get new lender have you heard of these problems with desk review is there really no recourse to having the desk reviewer lower the value based on errors in the appraisal worst thing is the buyer may have to end up paying for the appraisal anyway though he says he'll be filing complaint with someone if he has to pay
i've found it's very difficult to find people to lend on loan less than 100 because they complain they can't make any money i'm guessing that's because they come up against some federal maximum in terms of charges that can be made in closing on loan if so what is it and are they loan broker at the mercy of escrow and title costs

google got verizon to stop throttling its bandwidth for land lines that's actually wrong too verizon was never throttling google and this is not huge step forward for net neutrality what's being hashed out here is closed door deal between verizon and google prohibiting something verizon wasn't doing in the first place verizon does not cap or throttle its broadband services the purpose is so that verizon and google can put neutrality rules in place they like that have huge loopholes like not applying to wireless before the fcc can enact tough rules that might actually wind up protecting consumers
you've got it right these companies write our laws make no mistake about it in this case verizon and google want to hash out their version of network neutrality with limited public input pre-empting tougher fcc rules or authority and google's involvement in this process does not mean this agreement will be in consumers best interests
google made verizon agree to stop selectively degrading speed for landlines verizon was never selectively degrading speed for landlines they have no caps and they don't throttle heavy users either they do cap and throttle wireless and there's more of that coming correct the deal is likely just loose series of let's play nice agreements aimed at pre-empting tougher fcc regulations through wimpy self-regulatory arrangement think most of the stories be they cnet or the nytimes are wrong in google agreeing to any kind of paid prioritization...that just doesn't seem likely
and of course verizon and google i'm sure are eager to pass voluntary self regulatory measures to pre-empt real privacy protection laws as well
with all due respect most of you guys and girls are being little gullible google didn't deny meeting with verizon to craft largely toothless net neutrality rules in order to pre-empt tougher fcc neutrality rules they simply denied agreeing to paying premium for prioritized residential traffic and while the times may be wrong about google agreeing to pay for prioritized traffic and who knows maybe the source was talking about striking deal for some other kind of prioritization there's about dozen other outlets confirming that google is now essentially siding with verizon in order to protect their android partnership cash cow to simplify google is trying to stop real neutrality rules from being crafted by working with verizon to create toothless self-regulatory system that won't work in broadband sector where there's very limited broadband competition they're also working with verizon on wimpy self-regulatory privacy policies in the hopes of pre-empting real privacy laws as well http://gizmodo.com/5605568/fcc-chief-killing-of-net-neutrality-would-be-unacceptable

yeah i'm accessing amazon and ebay through their apis but i'm scraping duke for the actual books required for courses thought the slowness was just on my end should probably cache the results so commonly accessed books come up faster thanks for the tips
i'm just trying to make things easier for students use amazon and ebay for my books and last semester was surprised that lot of my friends just bought them from the store it was also just little project undertook to help me learn/practice some coding
i'm sure the downvotes were because may have seemed unsympathetic don't think sympathy in this context would help you or anyone like you was interested in stimulating discussion certainly agree the common symptoms that appear in sexual abuse victims are related to the abuse--i just wonder how much of it is stigma how much is the lack of trust the pain think the stigma is underestimated in society today think if people can talk about it and be safe talking about it and not think everyone thinks they are dirty it can help maybe i'm wrong just think the sex is not the culprit think there is probably inappropriate sex going on between kids that is not damaging and i'm not supporting it or excusing it where it is wrong good luck thanks for the response and screw the haters
that's good idea was worried that storing the information locally would result in inaccurate results at times some classes are still bookless but guess could just update the database nightly thanks again man much appreciated
i'll get on that first thing tomorrow just don't ask me to optimize if for ie or anything outlandish like that edit i'm looking at it now in opera 10.6 on my mac and it looks fine what version and os are you using and what seems to be out of place
ahh so google's denial was technically correct google's denial was technical exactly they denied particular errors in the ny times story but ignored the twelve other news outlets that got things more or less right and honestly the only thing the times got wrong is that the agreement involved allowing pay tiers for consumers which suggests the times writer sucks or didn't understand his source not that all the info was bad
if you understand anything from this convoluted mess of story understand this google has decided to side with verizon to create voluntary weak-ass self-regulatory policies aimed at preventing real consumer network neutrality protections in order to protect their profitable android deal with verizon note under this proposal there would not only be weak rules in place and no real power at the fcc to enforce them but they would not apply to wireless networks in any fashion
yeah haha you can tell i'm not an english major and thanks appreciate any word of mouth attention can get and building book database as type this so by tonight should have the performance issues ironed out
oh hi
well right the detail essentially leaves giant loophole that leaves universe of managed services uncovered by this proposal the only thing think the times really got wrong is the headline which suggests paid tiers of residential service and infers the beat reporter was new to covering neutrality and/or didn't understand his source
true the unreported and interesting thing is and cover this sector for living for going on decade that think based on sources that don't want to go on the record verizon was the ones who leaked the proposal last week in order to get it framed in the press but the times screwed it up with shitty article that confused terms and yeah then it's easy for google and verizon to spend time vilifying the ny times and deflecting from the real issue which is that this is all essentially dog and pony show aimed at gutting real consumer protections the real world is complicated and stuff
proof it's real damn internet you scary was convinced this was fake
sonny even considered that clemenza may have had hand in selling out the don tessio was always smarter
think it's important to look at the actual survey question and response breakdown to that question http://www.pewinternet.org/reports/2010/home-broadband-2010.aspx americans were asked do you think that expanding affordable high-speed internet access to everyone in the country should be top priority for the federal government important but lower priority not too important or should it not be done the majority chose the last two options 26 of americans say that expansion of affordable broadband access should not be attempted by government 27 said it was not too important priority 30 said it was an important priority 11 said it should be top priority the majority actually said it was either very important or something the government should do just not above all else which strikes me as accurate that said an fcc survey recently found that 80 of americans don't even know what broadband speed they have despite signing up for clearly marked tier at sale another survey released today showed 56 don't know what fiber to the home is as somebody who has covered the broadband sector for decade i'll note and this may shock you most consumers are pretty clueless about broadband in general so polls asking them what they think about government helping push cheaper broadband should be taken with pretty big grain of salt also look at how many americans can find the uk or egypt on map

i'm not saying that in the history of the united states no one has ever stood up for an oppressed group the example you included is clearly recent evidence of that but it was organized it was planned people had the opportunity to really consider the implications and make the right choice what i'm questioning is whether you or at any given moment while we are in the middle of our own lives and whatever we're late to instantly determine that something is amiss that someone is unfairly being picked upon that the right thing to do is to step into someone else's situation and defend them don't doubt any one of us would not want to be one of the yelling neighbors but know that if just happened to see this outside of my neighbors door with no one else saying anything me with my life and problems would stop and do something no might gawk might think to say something but i'd probably keep on going about my day don't think that makes me bad person its just how we're taught to deal with situations assess if it effects you keep out of other people's business on the other hand in this neighborhood someone some neighbor did just the opposite of that and with he or she as an example others had an opportunity to either join or be passive my question is whether it's cultural difference to do that whether it's american to mind one's own business or is it in our nature to risk embarrassing ourselves and defend against something we've just walked into like said i'd like to think that at least one of my neighbors would do the same but highly doubt it please don't take offense to any of this i'm just telling you how i'd perceive this situation

cool any chance you could share the source code or tell us what language you used
water politics are complex the lower part of the state has water rights which are conditioned on the flow through the rivers dry year they don't get as much and no matter how much they get there is still plenty of water for us in the north there is almost never rationing up here we have greater rights in that the water falls here the fact that the southern half of the state takes water does not affect how much water we use here
southern california they have pretty much changed their usage to save as much water as they can sure there are people with lots of money who pay extra for their landscaping but in terms of efficiency of irrigation they have already pretty much cut down as much waste as they can
the fact that there are economic gains to some due to the monterey agreements does not mean that they are in fact bad for everyone the way water is transferred and who and how they are making money are function of luck as much as anyone nobody knows who will need to buy water next year the monterey agreements made it possible for contractors to exchange the water more easily this article is looking at the effects of the monterey agreements and saying that because someone made money they were bad thing that's not necessarily true there are plenty of environmentalists who will twist the data any way they see fit to throw rocks
the city and county of san francisco gets their water from the mountains to the east in terms of throwing blame at la for taking norcal water sf is far worse in that there are ton of people in tiny area expecting to be serviced from someone else's watershed

yes they get water from mono lake--they bought the water rights they also get water from the colorado river and from the california aqueduct
there is limited supply of water yes and since they've cut much of the waste due to inefficient irrigation and landscaping practices decisions have to be made about how to allocate the water when there is shortage there is already method in place to do that this lawsuit is about people who don't trust the ones making the decisions have worked in water for almost 20 years and don't understand all the intricacies of the decision making--but know enough that this article and your comment are lacking in understanding of the allocations anyone can stand back and say the fish need more water so we can't send more water to la that doesn't make it so
think my initial point was that many parts of california get their water from someone else's watershed wasn't criticizing sf for taking water from the mokelumne river my initial comment was that la taking water from the delta doesn't cause rationing in norcal that was responded to by someone who remembers the water supply issues in sf from early 90 my response was to point out that sf gets it's water basically same way la gets their water sorry if wasn't clear about that la taking water from the delta didn't cause rationing in sf interestingly have worked recently on re-plumbing some lines to upgrade potential supplies from the delta to sf--supplies for which sf has no water rights but it's considered the right thing to do
keeping water unsustainably cheap is not good plan water is renewable if the price goes up the price goes up it is good idea to plan with realistic ideas as to future availability but increasing the price artifiically now is not necessarily good idea though if people would go for it would like that
san francisco has almost no natural water supply and gets its water from elsewhere and if it didn't there wouldn't be water problems in the rest of the state san francisco needs to build desalinization plants california is all one big state there is no norcal and socal water rights are established live in norcal love it we have plenty of water when there is limited flows through the norcal rivers due to drought pumping to socal is curtailed it does not create problems for us believe your argument is an uneducated one

i'm not saying there aren't serious issues of course there are you don't think sf has anything to do with our water issues people don't think in those terms because sf is in norcal but it certainly doesn't have watershed to provide water to the huge number of people who live there the water is imported it's no different from us sending water from norcal to socal

if we stop delivering water to the bay area the 15 million people who live there will not be affected unless you have clue how much water is provided to the various areas and how much would naturally go out to sea if we didn't capture and use it this is really pointless discussion lots of people like to stand on the it's not natural argument but that's bullshit either nothing man does is natural hence sf should not be taking water from the mountains or everything man does is natural hence we should watch what we do and carefully plan the impacts of our changes to the world around us think you and many people like to pretend that there has been no planning of the state's use of water--you stand back and say the southern part of the state is desert but you don't really have any idea how much planning has gone into the systems in place know little--i actually know lot about small parts of the systesm but know there are others who do study all the different parts people like you stand on the outside without clue and make generalizations it doesn't matter if the water goes to la or sf if it's coming from the same source--not to the environment it doesn't

so uh you don't see difference between her dabbling and obama occassionally going to church where guy later said some stuff obama didn't agree with
the state water project decreases deliveries to farmers in dry year they don't decrease deliveries to cities there is system in place to regulate usage based on availability to make blanket statement that the farms in the central valley are unsustainable is inaccurate
thought there were complaints that he didn't attend church often enough he doesn't go every week it seemed pretty clear from the video saw that obama didn't agree with everything that wright said you stop going to church when you disagree with something your pastor says do you have any idea how often or how vehemently he espouses whatever it is you disagree with bet you don't have clue the woman is moron that's enough don't think her dabbling in witchcraft means anything witchcraft is horseshit it doesn't do anything but if she's so godfearing what was she doing there
are you not saying that farming in the central valley is unsustainable do you have annual water usage for the bay area for comparison with swp and cvp exports to the central valley per annum that would be legitimate comparison can find swp did quick search for ebmud and didn't find anything--since you're so up on this let me know what you find
the entire lower third of the state has water because they're sucking the top two thirds dry personally think the los angeles and san diego areas should be required to build desalination plants to supply their own water you don't say it's unsustainable you just describe unsustainability in your presentation of the affects of sending water from northern california to southern california california has been sending water from the delta to the farmers in the central valley since the 30 clearly it's possible
every time update this to see where we are you've edited this comment are you done
guess i'm unclear as to what exactly you're trying to say the state of california and the federal government have been providing sufficient water to the california central valley for fifty years to sustain many many acres of farmland in dry years the water quantity is curtailed think you are trying to say they should build desal plants instead of pumping the water the fifty or so years of history alone is enough for me to say your statement is incorrect you also seem to not notice that the water that is used by the people in the bay area if it were not trapped in the mountains and transported down to the urban areas via pipelines would be unusable by the time it got down to the bay area through the natural waterways the water all the way up to fairfield would be too salty to use so the bay area just like socal is benefiting from water artificially being provided from outside it's own area
it's more difficult to keep desert green than than what what is my strawman what is your argument what are you talking about
your statement doesn't mean anything it does not lead to the conclusion that desal plants are necessary anywhere it is possible and beneficial to the state as whole to pump water to the farms in the central valley they don't need desal plants it doesn't matter if it's more difficult as you put it--the cost/benefit ratio is greater than one desal plants have c/b ratio less than one

had vasectomy 15 years ago and reverse vasectomy years ago no birth control with second wife for last year and no pregnancy the urologist told me that after reverse vasectomy scar tissue can build up blocking the vas defrans leaving you sterile again--which seems probably to have happened again know the reverse vasectomy worked years ago but nothing now unless my wife is the issue--possibly but not likely anyway sorry for your problem but vasectomy followed by reverse vasectomy may have its own problems

her lawyer did look like bitch think the entire reason nicki diaz went to lawyer was because as she claims when she asked meg for help getting green card meg laughed at her and fired her have no sympathy for nicki diaz or meg whitman

years ago in high school english we were going over hamlet in class had already read it and was bored out of my mind so started reading douglas adams book the teacher sees me not paying attention so he asks the class question and then directs it at me to catch me off guard and make me look dumb well being able to pay attention to more than one thing at time respond with an insightful answer the teacher says good answer and obviously perturbed by me goes back to his lesson go back to my book five minutes later he can't take it any more he never really liked me so he stops class and quite loudly asks me what book could possibly be more important than shakespeare's hamlet calmly turn the cover of the book to the class and read the title live the universe and everything the teacher turns bright red and ignores me for the rest of class

you are as much to blame for this current state of religious fundamentalism as the right wing think you should reconsider this statement--right wing fundamentalism certainly can live in vacuum of atheism don't recall any atheist parrying of the wahabists in saudi arabia would you not say they are fundamentalist
seriously doubt christians are voting more because of atheists more likely they are voting more out of fears about taxes immigration abortion etc it's not coincidence that the softminded love these issues as much as pushing their beliefs on others think it's disingenuous to characterize atheists as the more offensive of the groups by the way appreciate what you're trying to say just don't agree with all of it

mean this in loving way there is one problem with your question that will answer it and it comes at the end it says undeserved suffering the bible says in the book of ephesians that we are children of wrath which we are by nature it follows by saying the best words ever written..but god being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us even when we were dead in our transgressions made us alive together with christ we dont deserve anything we deserve hell but god in his great mercy offers salvation ephesians chapter will help you as well as the first chapters of romans
either way it is still poptart with meat inside
because by creating us by nature as sinful it gives him the opportunity to display his glory by sending his son jesus into the world to save people from their sins read ephesians and romans 1-9

tip nobody knows what's in the rules because they haven't been made public yet but given that at&amp was the one spending the most time shaping them in private meetings with the fcc they aren't going to be good and while the rules are likely going to be bad as in endless loopholes and no real protection for wireless services republicans are just opposing it because that's what they do
yes
it's common in canada but not common here time warner cable tried to impose system where they charged up to per gigabyte and customers revolted there's no practical reason to impose such limits on terrestrial networks given the fixed or dropping costs for most bandwidth and hardware and the fact that existing flat rate pricing is already perfectly profitable though investors industry executives and their hired tools will get breathless telling you otherwise
the cost to them is the same whether you transmit 40 gigs or most isp costs are fixed and existing pricing covers all of them investors are driving this metered billing push because the smart ones know that tv amp voice revenues will take hit as everything just becomes data and people begin to have cheaper choices elsewhere isps like to use the electricity utility example but it doesn't really apply also they absolutely don't want to be regulated like utility....which is something you'd want since you're essentially agreeing to bandwidth meter
they are related in that imposing caps is way for monopoly/duopoly carriers to exert new power on the content ecosystem that will ultimately move away from traditional tv
folks i've written about this sector for decade and this guy/gal is 100 correct
the sad thing about all this is that we're all supposed to be on the same team here general aviation is small community that unfortunately grows smaller every year nobody's getting rich here and the sites they went after first were the ones least able to defend themselves hobbyist sites set up by fellow pilots they were able to convince the uspto to grant them patent something that is obvious to anyone skilled in the art and in spite of clear evidence of prior art then immediately turned around and lawyered up that is the textbook definition of patent trolling i'm student pilot in my 20 don't have to tell you how expensive and time-consuming the process of earning license is tools like runwayfinder were pretty essential part of my education allowing me to examine charts nationwide and easily learn how to plot flights in taking this action they've killed tool that was not just great help to pilots but was part of aviation education as well not only have they made flying harder for current pilots but they've added yet another expense/hurdle that students must now overcome at the very time ga is trying hard to attract new pilots essentially by taking these actions flightprep has screwed the entire aviation brotherhood
no as somebody who has covered the broadband industry full time for ten years the shift toward monetizing every single byte is absolutely part of the network neutrality discussion charging unreasonable amounts of money per gigabyte to protect tv revenues from internet video is part of the equation to be considered in an open internet
caps as the tend to exist today are being applied agnostically ie my cap gets hit equally by traffic sources from fancast as comcast customer as they are by traffic sourced from hulu right but that's not related to my point if you're talking about caps that favor traffic sourced from the isp agree but that's not question of the cap that's question of favored/tiered access the mere imposition of caps is not neutrality issue you need further characteristics to enter the realm to be clear i'm not just talking about caps caps act to differentiate residential and business class tiers and i've not been opposed to them i'm talking about per gigabyte overages up to something that was tried last year by time warner cable again like said above trying to monetize every byte to punitive effect is part of the neutrality discussion because it's way for cable company to enact artificial barriers to entry for internet video we don't have overages here in the states yet like canada but there's not an isp out there that doesn't wish we did
think so it's pretty damned muddy issue my point is that these pricing models being considered by u.s. isps to overly monetize every bit can also be used to discriminate against content is all
i'm trying to understand why we haven't seen any comedian even close to this guy all we seem to get is an army of dane cooks is it because comedian amp borderline prophet like him can't succeed in the current shallow culture and corporate-controlled information ecosystem i'm no fan of hero worship but get pretty close with this guy

the box is 44 x30 and it's hung like cabinets on studs it passed an earthquake test the construction idea was to be able to open it by sliding the plexiglas up through the slit so that he could read the book since it was bitch to actually get it set right the plexiglas bows if it's not fitted in the grooves hindsight should've just done hinges and called it day

found really nutty woman yesterday on craigslist who was willing to take one she told me her last baby goat died because the people who had it before her hadn't fed it enough certainly possible and that she kept the goat in her room wearing diaper other things she said and things she didn't say led me to believe the goats had better chance if one did not go there
thank you for prompting me to look further found ken and nancy goat rescuers in sonoma county by searching again on craigslist we are meeting in vallejo at 9pm we talked long time and these are the right people to take care of my little bobby and simon

like how they go from the average retirement collected is 2000 to of course some collect much more well no shit--probably half collect more and smaller percentage collect much more it's always the right wingers attacking public retirement and using cops retirement as their examples--yet they're the fucking ones who give the cops their sweet deal cops can retire at 50 with 90 of their salary if they worked 30 years on the job okay and the article doesn't say it but some people retire with 100 though for most people they'll have to work 40 years on the job and retire at 65 to get that not sure if cops can get more than 90

hated gyms but knew needed to do something to lose weight was borderline overweight and wanted to get in shape before trying to have baby joined local crossfit because needed someone to kick my butt into shape i've been eating better but there's always room for improvement what's very stressful is watching my husband go to gold's gym then come home with fast food in hand love when he tries making the point of go to the gym so can eat this way but regardless of what he's doing at the gym he's still gaining weight he's got built arms neck and chest but little gut and love handles along for the ride search the internet high and low for new recipes to try and if don't have particular ingredient substitute with something do have to avoid grocery shopping for single item if ask him how the meal is he usually asks if followed the recipe when tell him all but or ingredients he gives me grief for not doing it right he rarely ever cooks and if he does he throws pre-made dinner like voila into the pan and calls it night i'm not sure what to do about him because he's not very encouraging he knows want to lose weight but he'll purposely ask if want to go to krispy kreme just to make me think about it even though he has no intentions of driving across town i've lose 13 lbs since joined crossfit in september so i'm happy about that don't plan on stopping anytime soon just wish my husband was more supportive sorry to vent in your thread didn't expect my rant to go on that long and felt bad making new thread just to complain

the discussion of sex offenders came about at work today someone was on the sex offender tracking website and was pointing out how many lived in mile radius of us the website did not list the full story behind them only what type of count they were charged with told my co-workers couple stories that have seen on reddit one story was regarding 20 year old male who pissed outside building and 17 year old girl saw him resulted in him now being registered sex offender how an adult male who works at daycare is not allowed to change diaper let alone be in the same room during diaper changing all because the daycare doesnt want any potential lawsuits to come about personally think it's all bit ridiculous remember being in elementary school and walking blocks to and from school and home even had to walk past pretty trashy trailer park which is often looked down upon had just as much chance of getting abducted as my hypothetical kids would today have theory on why parents are overprotective today have no facts to back this up this is all personal hypothesis when was kid everyone knew everyone in my neighborhood we had block parties all the kids hung out kids knew the parents and vice versa today know my neighbor directly next door to me and most of that is because they made the first effort to speak to my husband and me now admit that if had kids the same age as someone else's kids down the street may know more neighbors but i'm firm believer that online social networking has killed actual face-to-face networking i'm only 25 and hate saying this but back in my day you introduced yourself to neighbors and everyone seemed to keep an eye out for one another even now when you find an old friend on facebook that you havent spoken to in years after you both get past the omg how you been what's new lol great the nostalgia is over and you just read their status updates to find out what's new wow feel old

so my quick thoughts as somebody old enough to have bought pablo honey on cd at the college campus center it's good not as good as in rainbows absolutely nowhere near and not return to ok computer and the bends and anybody who knows radiohead knows that day's never coming anyway radiohead clearly likes burial there's shades of bon iver there's not single screaming guitar which continues to make me sad and personally liked thom yorke more when he was terrified of massive stadium tours think the band lost something when they decided that real rock and roll was passe and that odd technology bleats were an ample substitute for painfully overworked amplifier that said it's still very very good there's many layers and lots of fantastic subtle lovely moments give up the ghost has hints of bon iver think lotus flower is probably the best and most uptempo track on the album it's too short it's little phoned in by guys used to wealth it's beautiful
understand that people confused my post as real in the age of the tea party apologize really was kidding
sounds like djibouti is the one that's collapsing
besides saying something like absolutely nowhere near and not return to ok computer implies that ok computer is somehow more important or interesting record well all taste is subjective but for many critics and fans that album will be for me it was my soundtrack to life on nyc subways in the 90 and probably can't be supplanted agree about it feeling like b-sides with few exceptions also again too short

free hey genius you consider the pension and healthcare is part of our compensation for the work we do that thought cross your mind
guess you're familiar with their structure then yes you are aware that california's pensions are underfunded by about 20 and that during the boom years of the 90 when was paying my of my salary into my pension the state wasn't paying their agreed of course if they had been paying the unfunded liability would be much much smaller you capitalize not as if you understood the numbers involved beg you do more research
not sure exactly what you're getting at as understand it state workers gave up the right to strike when they accepted collective bargaining rights that's hell of tradeoff i've always worked under contract which has agreed that the union members will never strike we'll always work under the old contract if there is no new contract i'd like to see my employer just continue the existing contract until something new is agreed to

jehovah's witnesses have actually pretty damn good translation of the bible in my opinion it's very close to the original scriptures i'm guessing you heard that from jw you might want to read something interesting like misquoting jesus if you want to learn bit about where the scripture people read today come from oh and good luck have good friend who has been disfellowshipped for 15 years and keeps going back don't get it at all when he's most fervently trying to get back in good with the jw church he's very distant with me it's always been tiny bit annoying to me

guess wanted to point out that unless you knew what the originals were you wouldn't have clue if you got good translation since the originals mostly don't exist the best you can hope for is good translation of an early copy maybe the jws have that read the book suggested and you might find it doesn't matter what copy they used--they probably don't have something free of change that said if you are really agnostic you should be as likely to believe in the hindu scripts as the bible so it doesn't really matter how accurate the scripts are--they're all crap anyway

the broadband sector has actually been repeatedly deregulated the problem isn't regulation the problem is government protectionism and government denial to do anything about the resulting duopoly and monopoly markets france actually took our 1996 now-defunct law on requiring local loop unbundling allowing competitors access to incumbent network and line sharing and made it work

with most new stuff write in php make it habit to use filter http://php.net/manual/en/book.filter.php especially since it's included in 5.2 with filter you define explicit what you want and how you want to get it input filter_input_array input_get array var1 gt filter_sanitize_string this way you get only what you're expecting in the format you're expecting it it also has the added benefit of making you think very carefully about what inputs your script takes it takes little bit more discipline than just saying _get var1 but it's worth it imho

the fireboss is an airtractor specially modified for firefighting ops by wipaire at my home field of ksgs the tricky thing about fireboss is that even though it's float plane it doesn't float when the water tanks are full the plane will take off from land or water empty do high speed skim of the water's surface with probe extended to fill up the tanks then fly off to the fire if they get too slow on that skim they are in trouble cause with those tanks full it's too much for the floats

don't mine taking while for prep in baking and pastry that's lot of the process because measuring and scaling can greatly impact the final product do also like making quicker meals there's actually cupcakes that you can make in coffee mug in 3-5 minutes delicious recipes are very important to me goes along with the whole measuring thing baking can be screwed up quite easily so following the recipe and measuring is important love first person shooters and i'm pretty good at them but love minecraft the simplicity is enjoyable multiplayers and left for dead are my favorites though competitive multiplayers fun

we girls are weird showing that you care can mean one of two things being there and supporting her and showing her love or buying her things certainly hope it's not the latter though that might be easier to deal with think the easiest thing for you to do would be to accept that what's in her past is the past you have mistakes and hurts but you have to learn from those and move on being stuck in the past won't help anything you shouldn't have to deal with things from her past relationship just help her to understand how to put things in her past and be there to support her even if she will leave you helping her through this is important it seems it's what she wants if you care about her help her get over her past then hopefully she'll see there's future with you
i'm in similar situation with my boyfriend but it's way more complicated yes it took time to get over my past and there are things i'm still bitter about but if you can't work through her past together she'll be stuck there good luck

just question to ask yourself where do you think these laws came from and dont mean from the people who appointed them if there is no god and there is no standard by which moral law can come from how do humans know that it was ever wrong to murder or to steal

that is the most epic example of neckbeard have ever seen upvotes for you sir
you didnt answer my question that asked how can humans know morality right or wrong if there is not some standard or moral law from which it originates of course no human wants to be murdered they know this naturally humans desire life but if there is no moral law or standard from which they know it is wrong to murder then they would have no objection to doing this to others concerning your point about adam and eve they did not murder that was cain and abel their children god commanded adam and eve not to eat from the tree of life in the garden of eden it was clear to them not do this this because god commanded them or set moral standard for them not to eat from this particular tree satan used this moral law or standard to tempt them into doing this and breaking god's command so yes they did know standard of morality because god layed this out for them yet they still sinned against god regarding your argument about cold blooded murder and self defense personally believe there is difference between to murder and to kill exodus 20:13 says you shall not murder am christian and this is moral dilemma that have encountered in trying to develop my personal world-view the question asked myself was how can god kill so many people in the old testament yet tell me as christian not to murder the only answer is that murder and killing must be two seperate but similar things to murder is to cause the death of someone with harmful intentions with the specific intent to only take the life of someone to kill is to cause the death of someone with another motivation to better yourself and the others around you for good ex war for better understanding the text which point you to is romans chapter 13 romans 13 also is my explanation for how is it ok for christian to be in the army or fight for their country they submit to the authorities placed over them which god in his sovereign control appointed to answer your counter questions god doesnt grant morality to animals god distinctly created humans being in his own image as the bible says and animals were not created in his own image genesis 1:27 you said animals dont murder each other which they dont but in fact they do kill each other lions kill and eat their prey that is how they survive it is natural instinct for them to survive humans are naturally and inherently evil because of adam and eve's sin romans 5:12 regarding animals of their own species killing each other sometimes they do kill each other when they fight over different things sometimes they do not kill each other because they rely on each other for survival and companionship as well just wanted to also let you know that do respect your opinion and enjoy talking to someone who isn't christian it helps me be able to learn defend my beliefs better and understand where they are coming from as well let me know what you think and what your opinion is regarding what have mentioned
yeah these cgi effects are getting pretty realistic though huh
did you purposely make it sync with katy perry http://www.youtube.com/watch ycc_32k2coq
my point is and we clearly differ in opinions believe that morality cannot come from nothing it must be defined by something or someone god and had to have some origin other than human ideal you as an athiest assume believe that it can come from human nature and understanding alone regarding adam and eve again you said that they did not know what they were doing when they sinned am certain and know that they knew exactly what they were doing when they made this choice it was impossible for them not to understand their choice especially with how clearly god placed his moral standard and law in front of them to clearly not eat from the tree it is simple if someone says dont eat from tree know that shouldnt eat from the tree adam and eve both knew what they did was wrong simply because god told them not to it is as simple as that they dont need strict moral law and code written in front of them to understand that they were not supposed to eat from the tree of life so your point is senseless your point regarding the ten commandments also doesnt make sense concerning point you made earlier you argued that humans know that it is wrong to murder and that is why they dont do it because they create or define morality your opinion of morality comes from this human ideal and understanding alone so if humans define their own morality they still are able to understand that what god had given them 10 commandments is what they should do whether he had given it to them or they created it themselves from your opinion humans create their own morality so even if god gave it to them they would still be able to understand it because they would understand morality which they created your next point about jesus saving your sins no matter what is also skewed if someone is truly saved then they will have received god's grace and christ's righteousness will have been imputed to them through his death on the cross they will in turn receive the holy spirit who will give them new desires and new hate for sin as well as christian still know that sin everyday but my motivation is not to just keep on sinning because have jesus as get out of jail free card still sin because struggle with my flesh but even though do often sin its not what truly desire and that is to honor god in everything that do paul says it best in the end of romans to romans should we sin that grace may abound absolutely not the next part hope you will find is not straight out of sunday school class but is deep christian doctrine to answer your question did god appoint hitler and know you think am crazy but the answer...yes god appointed hitler you now are thinking am completely stupid and moron but will show why find this to be true the first biblical doctrine am going to mention is gods sovereignty this as am sure you know means that god is in complete and utter control of every single thing which happens he is in control of all of the situations going on in libya right now and japan as well he is sovereign so if god is sovereign and in complete control yes he did appoint hitler romans 9:21 attests to this when it says has the potter god no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use another christian biblical doctrine to go along with this verse and god's sovereignty is predestination predestination means that god foreknew before the creation of the world everyone who was going to be saved and who wasnt going to be saved and he chose them with perfect and specific intentions you are saying immediately this isnt moral how can this be immediately refer back to romans 9:21 god is perfect and he has the right to do what he wills to accomplish his purpose so is it okay for god to appoint hitler and for him to predestine some people to heaven and some to hell yes it is hope you found this to be little deeper than sunday school class understand that you have made the choice to accept whatever your belief is and hope that made myself clear you said sound naive and innocent to answer that am only 17 years old and you are probably much older than am know just as much biblical doctrine as some preachers and have memorized the entire book of ephesians chapters you can look it up to see how long it is along with many psalms and am currently memorizing romans chapter for bible study class which help teach am sure that you will have more questions and will be glad to answer or listen to your opinion also hope you will look up some of these passages which have mentioned to help understand what my argument is romans is what highly recommend get some rest
