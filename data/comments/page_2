ok favorite movie that you would think have an amaze script
honestly....yeah if dialogue scar you then right it out without as for the script you can beat out the story in three act set up scenes without dialogue and then fill in the blank last
ha don't know him sorry but if you've ever be fan of that 70 show you might want to check this out http://www.harpers.org/archive/2002/03/0079095 as for american beauty alan ball vs judd apatow it's completely different alan ball be genius so i'm will to bet the execution of that movie be pretty close to his intention with judd it be lot of ad-libbing...a lot doubt the original script in anyway resemble the final product but they both end up work suppose
unfortunately we deal very little with music can tell you that executives at studios/networks who sole job it be to licence and use music for various film but i've never work that side of things but joe escalante former punk rocker for the vandals now entertainment attorney host radioshow dedicate to these kind of question and i'm pretty sure they have library of past question that might help you out http://barelylegalradio.com/site if you can't find the answer there you can always call in
from what know of my contact who do that its just matter of rummage through the countless cds they get send and track the popularity of new albums i'm sure there be an art to it the way music managers have relationships with the music execs have get to be the way literary managers know development execs
assuming you aren't steven spielberg jj abrams or about handful of other mega-successful creators then you'll have to go through some variation of the follow have sample something that people will read and think you'd be able to execute an idea pitch an idea to producer who have already read your sample and know you can execute goto studio/network with that producer and pitch your idea they'll look at your sample and gauge whether they like the idea enough to pursue if you get the go ahead you'll be give window to write out your idea the producer will give note and so will the studio/network eventually they'll either greenlight your idea kill it or give it to someone else to write as director it's similar but little different you'd generally have the script already and pitch your version of it and how you be go to make it different then they the studio could have imagine it it's never the case of non-megatalent non-writer come into the studio and pitch them an idea they'd still need to find the writer and expect you to have do the bulk of the package work to some capacity
not my area of expertise but gotta assume that's still true artists have always get fuck over by their label thank god for indie label and thank god for tour right
i'm certainly intrigue what make you put this together what's your background feel free to pm me if you prefer
just split hairs music producer be different than music label that be say completely agree with you think the best model for new musicians be to go out and play show selling your product directly to the consumer use the internet to get notariety but don't expect your sales to become from record store any more the time have change
love primer have no idea he write new script think he famously do everything for primer direct star do the music but once it be do go back to engineer i'm go to have to track that script down
agreed but i've be do it so long it actually feel like learn language to me like ceremonial dance we all have to do and have master email have definitely change things what's really amaze be how many conversations it take to get anywhere on project you still work the industry
all good open the door just know relatively little about music compare to other aspects of the industry
sadly we have pool of unpaid intern but i'll keep you in mind should we get money for readers you in la
its tough for sure the though that you would spend time and energy on something that be meaningless to anyone but you but if you don't do it then why do you want to be writer if you believe in that as career you need to able to write for yourself and hope that through practice someone else would like it to the job on set transition to writer's assistant isn't exactly how it go you want to get job as writer's pa and yes those job be hard to get if you haven't get it from anyone else can fwd you the latest uta joblist although that's more for development job then production if you want it just pm me your email and i'll fwd
ahh my advice stay up there as long as you can know there aren't as many film/tv opportunities up there but man its worth try to make it happen cause la be not great city

in perfect world manager or someone would have see the video and contact you already what you should do be write full script and/or series bible base on your animation and see if you can get some more buzz with second video or something to that extent unless you're concern its one hit wonder
difficult to say you could make the argument that recently at least since that article have come out there have be steady slew of counter examples juno baby momma friends with benefits ivan reitman's new movie however i'm not go to easily dismiss the sexism jennifer's get very particular viewpoint that i'm sure have be reinforce by examples in her life for our company specifically we do gear towards the male demo that's not to say we'll throw out script that do otherwise basically the most important thing be good original story secondary thoughts be who be the audience will people pay to see this etc etc some female-centered stories may not pass those secondary concern but at the very least it'll get that writer notice there be female executives and producers at every level of development but wouldn't be surprise if there be still an affinity towards male-centric movies even for female producers/execs
write script always because if you just shoot small pilot and its good they'll bring you in and say okay what do you have and you'll stare at them and point the the pilot you want to have the next thing ready so write the script first then shoot the short version of it so that when they bring you in you have something to show
there be rampant abuse of free labor in our industry but that's how it go everyone do unpaid internships at the start of their career and everyone use them on one side it be way in on the other it's hard work for no pay
again most actors be actually professionals there be few exceptions of course we once have to fire crew member for supposedly make talent feel uncomfortable after get this person approve through countless step and fly this person out to location end up only work week sometimes i've always be particularly harsh critic of movies sometimes know the background behind how movie get make can make the film appear less professional but by far the thing find most annoy be how terribly write most movies be use to be far more accommodate not anymore yes but not too often it's not an ethical thing its laziness thing i'm fortunate to live in los angeles so that band want to see almost always come through here and feel that by pay for their shows/merchandise justify download their mp3s as for movies i'm such stickler for the theater experience that rarely watch movies on my computer or even on my tv unless have no other options the majority of the top brass of the industry doesn't care how you watch their content they just don't want someone else profit cast and crew couldn't give shit they get pay it's worth note that despite pirate the economic crisis and series of union strike this have actually be financially successful year for the film industry go figure
think maybe you're troll because this seem little too extreme but ok low libido could be anything total refusal to engage in any sexual activity be indication of abuse if you love him you'll suggest he get counsel if he doesn't after repeat attempt go find somebody less fuck up

well it go beyond that in the fact that the website admins essentially tell users who use adblock to leave and that they create no value for the website that's great tell your userbase that you only create value for the site if you contribute to ad income ignore the fact that they contribute value simply by be part of the community and talk or share link elsewhere ars do some good work but there be some jackassery there
don't forget value be subjective while you may see value in community as do reddit bigger sit like ars may not be able to afford that luxury it's not really choice your userbase create value through participation the value of reddit be in its users because the users contribute all the content and at site like ars they push ars content they contribute insight to comment and they shape the direction of the website through recommendations to provide good content one must have good writers who research the subject provide unbiased analyse and do so in professional manner the people capable of provide say content likely want to get pay therefore in the eye of ars value be in revenue not simply view because view won't keep the site afloat it's not to say ad revenue isn't important but again users who use adblock still contribute to the site's value and revenues through participation and recommendation some of ars staff comment during that whole kerfuffle be insult and obnoxious besides ars have no role in dictate how users use their browsers and if they can't profit without tell their users they don't offer value if they don't click on ads maybe ars should find another business model
read mike masnick at techdirt's take on that whole ars ad thing think it explain why ars be wrong in great detail http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100306/1649198451.shtml
it amaze me the number of people here who be misequating 15 with the value of an investment of 15 in this company be to this judge regardless how this judge rule it wasn't go to make substantial difference to his bottom line/net worth/income rule one way and his 15 may go up to 17 k--or down to 13 k. who here think two thousand dollars be how much this judge value his job because that's what you're saying--he's dumb enough to risk his job over the profit or loss in this particular investment and it have nothing to do with the value to someone who have no money--this judge certainly have more than that
i'm guess that for much of pre-history the treatment you receive grow up would have be pretty common if that's true be they as fuck up as you or do you have issue relate to the stigma of have be victim of sexual abuse/incest or be you just fuck up because you couldn't trust anyone i'm guess contact with penis in and of itself wasn't actually harmful--it be the lack of control the feel associate comment
thank for response your long term emotional pain and fucked-up-edness have little to do with get ass-raped in my opinion i'm sure it hurt but no more than when catch yard dart in my head as kid i'm not fuck up about that today--the damage isn't due to the pain no stigma you never ever worry about how that knowledge might affect how others view you would tend to think it might be common to fear that others might misunderstand what have happen lead you to not want to talk about it i'm not say it's something that need to come up all the time but i'm guess there be time when it could come up that you avoid the subject hey correct me if i'm wrong think it's more likely that in prehistory the receivers of abuse just pass it on the those weaker later on when they have some power no point in get your ass kick again by someone who might still be bigger than you easier to just do what you want to the next generation might be troll i've know plenty of screw up people who be subject to abuse as children one who suffer far worse than you'll know and she's more screw up that just about anyone know i'm not go to appear too sympathetic to your plight--i don't think it's go to help anything if anything think you're do the right thing talk about it--it doesn't need to be that big fuck deal though you may never trust anyone ever good luck
mike holmes holmes on homes
i'm not say your problems be petty just human be just lucky my older brother who be fairly fuck up individual never get any more cruel than he do definitely have some emotional scar but there's no way to determine how much my issue be relate directly to him--and it doesn't matter now know the newer study show recovery from post traumatic stress syndrome which be probably pretty much what you have be easier if one mentally go back through the stressful situation and become more comfortable with the memory rather than stuff it down of course many who have such horrible memories don't want to relive think there probably be something powerful in be able to realize the things we go through be just things we go through guess i'm just say that because don't want to act like you get rap by your brother need to be something that haunt you think it's the social stigma in western society that keep people from get over the horrors of those type of things because they can't talk about them again not that you want to just that be able to might make it easier ah good luck
build my security system around ge simon xt the simon xt be the base station and you can just add on wireless sensors wherever you need them like door and window sensors glass break sensors motion smoke detectors ect the reason go with the simon be that it could be use as stand-alone unmonitored system or you can add gsm card and have it monitor by central dispatch currently have mine monitor by alarm.com which also give me full control over the system thru my iphone buy my system piece by piece use on ebay for few hundred
haven't have battery go dead yet and i've have the system instal for almost years the monitor thru alarm.com be actually resold by company call safemart.com my total be 31 per month but have their advanced plan this allow the system to text me when certain events happen like if my parent disarm the system to fee my dog and it will text me if the system isn't arm by certain time during certain days http://www.safemart.com/livewatch.htm have adt at my previous house and this setup be leap and bound better in every way and cheaper to boot
think his point that you're willfully ignore be that hate be far different from derogatory sure they're both negative but to call anything that be any shade of negative hate speech be to get into the zero tolerance area which be not useful that's why we have 18 year olds on the sex registry because of this zero tolerance bullshit you be perpetuate quit exaggerate
the word dyke be spell d-y-k-e this alone dispells your argument the word alone be not derogatory it's only your interpretation of their use i'm with the people who say you're be too sensitive
maybe you're be downvoted for be dumb-ass everyone know that the romans kill jesus to say the jews kill jesus because some local politicians/religious leaders may have conspire to have jesus send to the romans where he be so stupid he let himself be crucified--it's pretty dumb broad and inaccurate generalization
the jews be not represent by few local religious leaders who once upon time send jesus to the romans those local religious leaders be not the jews be contradict what you refer to as the jews send jesus to the romans be not the same as kill him the romans could have set jesus free if the romans have set jesus free would you be say the jews set jesus free if the romans have whip jesus would you be say the jews whip jesus i'd say no and no the local religious leaders send jesus to the romans who kill him it doesn't amount to the same thing when first read my first response to you think be rude and almost apologize after think second longer think be right and what you say be more along the line of unnecessarily race bait than characterize what the jews do
and in 2000 years it will be the americans who kill martin luther king because couple of people be up for it and few of their supporters be concentrate in the surround area disregard that the 50 of the people who support him and the other 25 of the people who didn't care weren't concentrate in that area the jewish religious leaders of that time didn't then and don't now represent the jews most jews then and today didn't give shit who jesus be jesus be kill by romans possibly at the behest of few local religious leaders
what can we do guess if we're go to be interest in represent the truth we shouldn't go out of our way to write elaborate explanations about how when someone say it be the jews that what they say be technically correct especially when it wasn't
you write it be the will and action of the jewish religious leaders that directly lead to his death why didn't you just say it be the action of jesus turn shit upside down that cause the local religious leaders to take him to the romans which directly lead to his death you be choose the start point artificially to put the cause at the feet of some jews in response to some guy say it be the jews who kill jesus maybe we're pick nits but think that your original response give the idea that the jews do it pass when it's bs those bs ideas be use in the past to kill many jews no i'm not jew or christian
i'd say the active role be do by the guy with the hammer jesus if he have half brain would have know the romans weren't go to put up with any shit on big holiday weekend in the center of commerce consider why he be probably actually kill as oppose to the conflict crap write in that book he should have figure he be go to get kill the romans didn't play around
and random us history trivia before the game you'd have to answer series of question to test whether you be 18 at least at the time of it's release 1987 but in retrospect doubt i'd even know the answer to them if be 18 this be all pre-internet so you'd just guess until you get it right and you'd need to get certain number in row to actually play otherwise you'd get boot out and have to start again and there be maybe pool of 30 question to answer so by the time be know lot of random facts tiptoe through the tulips be record by tiny tim and the last name of annette on the mickey mouse club be funicello fuck love that game

don't pay anyone to edit if you be confident in your write then that should be good enough if you're not take couple weeks off and re-read fresh the majority of scriptwriting contest be scams there be only few exceptions such as http://www.oscars.org/awards/nicholl/index.html it be an uphill battle if you be outside of the system its hard to get in if you know anyone inside the industry its time to bug them they'll probably hate you for it but they'll be your best shoot long shoot but can work go shoot one of your script or short base on your script submit that to festivals and when you get chance to meet with producers/managers ect you can tell and send them all your screenplays best of luck

you have to understand that to blogger slow news day be the equivalent of walk up to someone at cafe climb up on their table squat and shit in their coffee it's maybe worse give it happen so often and be so redundant kind of like the kardashians that bloggers and mods tend to over-react to it many mods just delete those comment because they're useless if you don't like story move the fuck on that say agree that ban people for it be jackassery and ban you in particular be particularly particular form of jackassery

i'd like to refi rental property but be go through short sale on primary principle residence or i'd like to buy new cheaper residence if put enough down can get any kind of loan haven't make payment on 1st or 2nd for this house for 18 months in case there be any straw to grasp
on my short sale the buyer's finance fell apart recently in this manner his dti be pretty high over 50 but when you add in the future rental income they be take it i'm tell it be chase buyer's credit be very good buyer have offer 85 only offer be list at 120 but my bank want 98 base on their bpo buyer finally agree to 98 because he really want the place there be comps over 100 in area and appraisal come in at 100 k. but apparently fannie require desk review of some percent of all loan now so some guy out of state review the appraisal and say it be only worth 90 base on some incomplete info on the appraisal my agent and the loan broker say there's no recourse to desk review--you can't contact them to answer their question on the loan so the deal die the buyer have to get new lender have you hear of these problems with desk review be there really no recourse to have the desk reviewer lower the value base on errors in the appraisal worst thing be the buyer may have to end up pay for the appraisal anyway though he say he'll be file complaint with someone if he have to pay
i've find it's very difficult to find people to lend on loan less than 100 because they complain they can't make any money i'm guess that's because they come up against some federal maximum in term of charge that can be make in close on loan if so what be it and be they loan broker at the mercy of escrow and title cost
how many kid with add do it take to screw in lightbulb wanna go ride bikes

google get verizon to stop throttle its bandwidth for land line that's actually wrong too verizon be never throttle google and this be not huge step forward for net neutrality what's be hash out here be close door deal between verizon and google prohibit something verizon wasn't do in the first place verizon do not cap or throttle its broadband service the purpose be so that verizon and google can put neutrality rule in place they like that have huge loopholes like not apply to wireless before the fcc can enact tough rule that might actually wind up protect consumers
you've get it right these company write our laws make no mistake about it in this case verizon and google want to hash out their version of network neutrality with limit public input pre-empting tougher fcc rule or authority and google's involvement in this process do not mean this agreement will be in consumers best interest
google make verizon agree to stop selectively degrade speed for landlines verizon be never selectively degrade speed for landlines they have no cap and they don't throttle heavy users either they do cap and throttle wireless and there's more of that come correct the deal be likely just loose series of let's play nice agreements aim at pre-empting tougher fcc regulations through wimpy self-regulatory arrangement think most of the stories be they cnet or the nytimes be wrong in google agree to any kind of pay prioritization...that just doesn't seem likely
and of course verizon and google i'm sure be eager to pass voluntary self regulatory measure to pre-empt real privacy protection laws as well
with all due respect most of you guy and girls be be little gullible google didn't deny meet with verizon to craft largely toothless net neutrality rule in order to pre-empt tougher fcc neutrality rule they simply deny agree to pay premium for prioritize residential traffic and while the times may be wrong about google agree to pay for prioritize traffic and who know maybe the source be talk about strike deal for some other kind of prioritization there's about dozen other outlets confirm that google be now essentially side with verizon in order to protect their android partnership cash cow to simplify google be try to stop real neutrality rule from be craft by work with verizon to create toothless self-regulatory system that won't work in broadband sector where there's very limit broadband competition they're also work with verizon on wimpy self-regulatory privacy policies in the hop of pre-empting real privacy laws as well http://gizmodo.com/5605568/fcc-chief-killing-of-net-neutrality-would-be-unacceptable

yeah i'm access amazon and ebay through their apis but i'm scrap duke for the actual book require for course think the slowness be just on my end should probably cache the result so commonly access book come up faster thanks for the tip
i'm just try to make things easier for students use amazon and ebay for my book and last semester be surprise that lot of my friends just buy them from the store it be also just little project undertake to help me learn/practice some cod
i'm sure the downvotes be because may have seem unsympathetic don't think sympathy in this context would help you or anyone like you be interest in stimulate discussion certainly agree the common symptoms that appear in sexual abuse victims be relate to the abuse--i just wonder how much of it be stigma how much be the lack of trust the pain think the stigma be underestimate in society today think if people can talk about it and be safe talk about it and not think everyone think they be dirty it can help maybe i'm wrong just think the sex be not the culprit think there be probably inappropriate sex go on between kid that be not damage and i'm not support it or excuse it where it be wrong good luck thank for the response and screw the haters
that's good idea be worry that store the information locally would result in inaccurate result at time some class be still bookless but guess could just update the database nightly thanks again man much appreciate
i'll get on that first thing tomorrow just don't ask me to optimize if for ie or anything outlandish like that edit i'm look at it now in opera 10.6 on my mac and it look fine what version and os be you use and what seem to be out of place
ahh so google's denial be technically correct google's denial be technical exactly they deny particular errors in the ny times story but ignore the twelve other news outlets that get things more or less right and honestly the only thing the times get wrong be that the agreement involve allow pay tiers for consumers which suggest the times writer suck or didn't understand his source not that all the info be bad
if you understand anything from this convolute mess of story understand this google have decide to side with verizon to create voluntary weak-ass self-regulatory policies aim at preventing real consumer network neutrality protections in order to protect their profitable android deal with verizon note under this proposal there would not only be weak rule in place and no real power at the fcc to enforce them but they would not apply to wireless network in any fashion
yeah haha you can tell i'm not an english major and thank appreciate any word of mouth attention can get and build book database as type this so by tonight should have the performance issue iron out
oh hi
well right the detail essentially leave giant loophole that leave universe of manage service uncover by this proposal the only thing think the times really get wrong be the headline which suggest pay tiers of residential service and infer the beat reporter be new to cover neutrality and/or didn't understand his source
true the unreported and interest thing be and cover this sector for live for go on decade that think base on source that don't want to go on the record verizon be the ones who leak the proposal last week in order to get it frame in the press but the times screw it up with shitty article that confuse term and yeah then it's easy for google and verizon to spend time vilify the ny times and deflect from the real issue which be that this be all essentially dog and pony show aim at gutting real consumer protections the real world be complicate and stuff
proof it's real damn internet you scary be convince this be fake
sonny even consider that clemenza may have have hand in sell out the don tessio be always smarter
think it's important to look at the actual survey question and response breakdown to that question http://www.pewinternet.org/reports/2010/home-broadband-2010.aspx americans be ask do you think that expand affordable high-speed internet access to everyone in the country should be top priority for the federal government important but lower priority not too important or should it not be do the majority choose the last two options 26 of americans say that expansion of affordable broadband access should not be attempt by government 27 say it be not too important priority 30 say it be an important priority 11 say it should be top priority the majority actually say it be either very important or something the government should do just not above all else which strike me as accurate that say an fcc survey recently find that 80 of americans don't even know what broadband speed they have despite sign up for clearly mark tier at sale another survey release today show 56 don't know what fiber to the home be as somebody who have cover the broadband sector for decade i'll note and this may shock you most consumers be pretty clueless about broadband in general so poll ask them what they think about government help push cheaper broadband should be take with pretty big grain of salt also look at how many americans can find the uk or egypt on map

cool any chance you could share the source code or tell us what language you use
water politics be complex the lower part of the state have water right which be condition on the flow through the rivers dry year they don't get as much and no matter how much they get there be still plenty of water for us in the north there be almost never ration up here we have greater right in that the water fall here the fact that the southern half of the state take water do not affect how much water we use here
southern california they have pretty much change their usage to save as much water as they can sure there be people with lot of money who pay extra for their landscape but in term of efficiency of irrigation they have already pretty much cut down as much waste as they can
the fact that there be economic gain to some due to the monterey agreements do not mean that they be in fact bad for everyone the way water be transfer and who and how they be make money be function of luck as much as anyone nobody know who will need to buy water next year the monterey agreements make it possible for contractors to exchange the water more easily this article be look at the effect of the monterey agreements and say that because someone make money they be bad thing that's not necessarily true there be plenty of environmentalists who will twist the data any way they see fit to throw rock
the city and county of san francisco get their water from the mountains to the east in term of throw blame at la for take norcal water sf be far worse in that there be ton of people in tiny area expect to be service from someone else's watershed

yes they get water from mono lake--they buy the water right they also get water from the colorado river and from the california aqueduct
there be limit supply of water yes and since they've cut much of the waste due to inefficient irrigation and landscape practice decisions have to be make about how to allocate the water when there be shortage there be already method in place to do that this lawsuit be about people who don't trust the ones make the decisions have work in water for almost 20 years and don't understand all the intricacies of the decision making--but know enough that this article and your comment be lack in understand of the allocations anyone can stand back and say the fish need more water so we can't send more water to la that doesn't make it so
think my initial point be that many part of california get their water from someone else's watershed wasn't criticize sf for take water from the mokelumne river my initial comment be that la take water from the delta doesn't cause ration in norcal that be respond to by someone who remember the water supply issue in sf from early 90 my response be to point out that sf get it's water basically same way la get their water sorry if wasn't clear about that la take water from the delta didn't cause ration in sf interestingly have work recently on re-plumbing some line to upgrade potential supply from the delta to sf--supplies for which sf have no water right but it's consider the right thing to do
keep water unsustainably cheap be not good plan water be renewable if the price go up the price go up it be good idea to plan with realistic ideas as to future availability but increase the price artifiically now be not necessarily good idea though if people would go for it would like that
san francisco have almost no natural water supply and get its water from elsewhere and if it didn't there wouldn't be water problems in the rest of the state san francisco need to build desalinization plant california be all one big state there be no norcal and socal water right be establish live in norcal love it we have plenty of water when there be limit flow through the norcal rivers due to drought pump to socal be curtail it do not create problems for us believe your argument be an uneducated one

i'm not say there aren't serious issue of course there be you don't think sf have anything to do with our water issue people don't think in those term because sf be in norcal but it certainly doesn't have watershed to provide water to the huge number of people who live there the water be import it's no different from us send water from norcal to socal

so uh you don't see difference between her dabble and obama occassionally go to church where guy later say some stuff obama didn't agree with
the state water project decrease deliveries to farmers in dry year they don't decrease deliveries to cities there be system in place to regulate usage base on availability to make blanket statement that the farm in the central valley be unsustainable be inaccurate
think there be complaints that he didn't attend church often enough he doesn't go every week it seem pretty clear from the video saw that obama didn't agree with everything that wright say you stop go to church when you disagree with something your pastor say do you have any idea how often or how vehemently he espouse whatever it be you disagree with bet you don't have clue the woman be moron that's enough don't think her dabble in witchcraft mean anything witchcraft be horseshit it doesn't do anything but if she's so godfearing what be she do there
be you not say that farm in the central valley be unsustainable do you have annual water usage for the bay area for comparison with swp and cvp export to the central valley per annum that would be legitimate comparison can find swp do quick search for ebmud and didn't find anything--since you're so up on this let me know what you find
the entire lower third of the state have water because they're suck the top two thirds dry personally think the los angeles and san diego areas should be require to build desalination plant to supply their own water you don't say it's unsustainable you just describe unsustainability in your presentation of the affect of send water from northern california to southern california california have be send water from the delta to the farmers in the central valley since the 30 clearly it's possible
every time update this to see where we be you've edit this comment be you do
guess i'm unclear as to what exactly you're try to say the state of california and the federal government have be provide sufficient water to the california central valley for fifty years to sustain many many acres of farmland in dry years the water quantity be curtail think you be try to say they should build desal plant instead of pump the water the fifty or so years of history alone be enough for me to say your statement be incorrect you also seem to not notice that the water that be use by the people in the bay area if it be not trap in the mountains and transport down to the urban areas via pipelines would be unusable by the time it get down to the bay area through the natural waterways the water all the way up to fairfield would be too salty to use so the bay area just like socal be benefit from water artificially be provide from outside it's own area
it's more difficult to keep desert green than than what what be my strawman what be your argument what be you talk about
your statement doesn't mean anything it do not lead to the conclusion that desal plant be necessary anywhere it be possible and beneficial to the state as whole to pump water to the farm in the central valley they don't need desal plant it doesn't matter if it's more difficult as you put it--the cost/benefit ratio be greater than one desal plant have c/b ratio less than one

tip nobody know what's in the rule because they haven't be make public yet but give that at&amp be the one spend the most time shape them in private meet with the fcc they aren't go to be good and while the rule be likely go to be bad as in endless loopholes and no real protection for wireless service republicans be just oppose it because that's what they do
yes
it's common in canada but not common here time warner cable try to impose system where they charge up to per gigabyte and customers revolt there's no practical reason to impose such limit on terrestrial network give the fix or drop cost for most bandwidth and hardware and the fact that exist flat rate price be already perfectly profitable though investors industry executives and their hire tool will get breathless tell you otherwise
the cost to them be the same whether you transmit 40 gigs or most isp cost be fix and exist price cover all of them investors be drive this meter bill push because the smart ones know that tv amp voice revenues will take hit as everything just become data and people begin to have cheaper choices elsewhere isps like to use the electricity utility example but it doesn't really apply also they absolutely don't want to be regulate like utility....which be something you'd want since you're essentially agree to bandwidth meter
they be relate in that impose cap be way for monopoly/duopoly carriers to exert new power on the content ecosystem that will ultimately move away from traditional tv
folks i've write about this sector for decade and this guy/gal be 100 correct
the sad thing about all this be that we're all suppose to be on the same team here general aviation be small community that unfortunately grow smaller every year nobody's get rich here and the sit they go after first be the ones least able to defend themselves hobbyist sit set up by fellow pilot they be able to convince the uspto to grant them patent something that be obvious to anyone skilled in the art and in spite of clear evidence of prior art then immediately turn around and lawyered up that be the textbook definition of patent troll i'm student pilot in my 20 don't have to tell you how expensive and time-consuming the process of earn license be tools like runwayfinder be pretty essential part of my education allow me to examine chart nationwide and easily learn how to plot flight in take this action they've kill tool that be not just great help to pilot but be part of aviation education as well not only have they make fly harder for current pilot but they've add yet another expense/hurdle that students must now overcome at the very time ga be try hard to attract new pilot essentially by take these action flightprep have screw the entire aviation brotherhood
no as somebody who have cover the broadband industry full time for ten years the shift toward monetize every single byte be absolutely part of the network neutrality discussion charging unreasonable amount of money per gigabyte to protect tv revenues from internet video be part of the equation to be consider in an open internet
caps as the tend to exist today be be apply agnostically ie my cap get hit equally by traffic source from fancast as comcast customer as they be by traffic source from hulu right but that's not relate to my point if you're talk about cap that favor traffic source from the isp agree but that's not question of the cap that's question of favored/tiered access the mere imposition of cap be not neutrality issue you need further characteristics to enter the realm to be clear i'm not just talk about cap caps act to differentiate residential and business class tiers and i've not be oppose to them i'm talk about per gigabyte overages up to something that be try last year by time warner cable again like say above try to monetize every byte to punitive effect be part of the neutrality discussion because it's way for cable company to enact artificial barriers to entry for internet video we don't have overages here in the states yet like canada but there's not an isp out there that doesn't wish we do
think so it's pretty damn muddy issue my point be that these price model be consider by u.s. isps to overly monetize every bite can also be use to discriminate against content be all

we girls be weird showing that you care can mean one of two things be there and support her and show her love or buy her things certainly hope it's not the latter though that might be easier to deal with think the easiest thing for you to do would be to accept that what's in her past be the past you have mistake and hurt but you have to learn from those and move on being stick in the past won't help anything you shouldn't have to deal with things from her past relationship just help her to understand how to put things in her past and be there to support her even if she will leave you help her through this be important it seem it's what she want if you care about her help her get over her past then hopefully she'll see there's future with you
i'm in similar situation with my boyfriend but it's way more complicate yes it take time to get over my past and there be things i'm still bitter about but if you can't work through her past together she'll be stick there good luck

that be the most epic example of neckbeard have ever see upvotes for you sir
you didnt answer my question that ask how can humans know morality right or wrong if there be not some standard or moral law from which it originate of course no human want to be murder they know this naturally humans desire life but if there be no moral law or standard from which they know it be wrong to murder then they would have no objection to do this to others concerning your point about adam and eve they do not murder that be cain and abel their children god command adam and eve not to eat from the tree of life in the garden of eden it be clear to them not do this this because god command them or set moral standard for them not to eat from this particular tree satan use this moral law or standard to tempt them into do this and break god's command so yes they do know standard of morality because god lay this out for them yet they still sin against god regarding your argument about cold blood murder and self defense personally believe there be difference between to murder and to kill exodus 20:13 say you shall not murder be christian and this be moral dilemma that have encounter in try to develop my personal world-view the question ask myself be how can god kill so many people in the old testament yet tell me as christian not to murder the only answer be that murder and kill must be two seperate but similar things to murder be to cause the death of someone with harmful intentions with the specific intent to only take the life of someone to kill be to cause the death of someone with another motivation to better yourself and the others around you for good ex war for better understand the text which point you to be romans chapter 13 romans 13 also be my explanation for how be it ok for christian to be in the army or fight for their country they submit to the authorities place over them which god in his sovereign control appoint to answer your counter question god doesnt grant morality to animals god distinctly create humans be in his own image as the bible say and animals be not create in his own image genesis 1:27 you say animals dont murder each other which they dont but in fact they do kill each other lions kill and eat their prey that be how they survive it be natural instinct for them to survive humans be naturally and inherently evil because of adam and eve's sin romans 5:12 regarding animals of their own species kill each other sometimes they do kill each other when they fight over different things sometimes they do not kill each other because they rely on each other for survival and companionship as well just want to also let you know that do respect your opinion and enjoy talk to someone who isn't christian it help me be able to learn defend my beliefs better and understand where they be come from as well let me know what you think and what your opinion be regard what have mention
yeah these cgi effect be get pretty realistic though huh
did you purposely make it sync with katy perry http://www.youtube.com/watch ycc_32k2coq
my point be and we clearly differ in opinions believe that morality cannot come from nothing it must be define by something or someone god and have to have some origin other than human ideal you as an athiest assume believe that it can come from human nature and understand alone regarding adam and eve again you say that they do not know what they be do when they sin be certain and know that they know exactly what they be do when they make this choice it be impossible for them not to understand their choice especially with how clearly god place his moral standard and law in front of them to clearly not eat from the tree it be simple if someone say dont eat from tree know that shouldnt eat from the tree adam and eve both know what they do be wrong simply because god tell them not to it be as simple as that they dont need strict moral law and code write in front of them to understand that they be not suppose to eat from the tree of life so your point be senseless your point regard the ten commandments also doesnt make sense concern point you make earlier you argue that humans know that it be wrong to murder and that be why they dont do it because they create or define morality your opinion of morality come from this human ideal and understand alone so if humans define their own morality they still be able to understand that what god have give them 10 commandments be what they should do whether he have give it to them or they create it themselves from your opinion humans create their own morality so even if god give it to them they would still be able to understand it because they would understand morality which they create your next point about jesus save your sin no matter what be also skew if someone be truly save then they will have receive god's grace and christ's righteousness will have be impute to them through his death on the cross they will in turn receive the holy spirit who will give them new desire and new hate for sin as well as christian still know that sin everyday but my motivation be not to just keep on sin because have jesus as get out of jail free card still sin because struggle with my flesh but even though do often sin its not what truly desire and that be to honor god in everything that do paul say it best in the end of romans to romans should we sin that grace may abound absolutely not the next part hope you will find be not straight out of sunday school class but be deep christian doctrine to answer your question do god appoint hitler and know you think be crazy but the answer...yes god appointed hitler you now be think be completely stupid and moron but will show why find this to be true the first biblical doctrine be go to mention be gods sovereignty this as be sure you know mean that god be in complete and utter control of every single thing which happen he be in control of all of the situations go on in libya right now and japan as well he be sovereign so if god be sovereign and in complete control yes he do appoint hitler romans 9:21 attest to this when it say has the potter god no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use another christian biblical doctrine to go along with this verse and god's sovereignty be predestination predestination mean that god foreknow before the creation of the world everyone who be go to be save and who wasnt go to be save and he choose them with perfect and specific intentions you be say immediately this isnt moral how can this be immediately refer back to romans 9:21 god be perfect and he have the right to do what he will to accomplish his purpose so be it okay for god to appoint hitler and for him to predestine some people to heaven and some to hell yes it be hope you find this to be little deeper than sunday school class understand that you have make the choice to accept whatever your belief be and hope that make myself clear you say sound naive and innocent to answer that be only 17 years old and you be probably much older than be know just as much biblical doctrine as some preachers and have memorize the entire book of ephesians chapters you can look it up to see how long it be along with many psalm and be currently memorize romans chapter for bible study class which help teach be sure that you will have more question and will be glad to answer or listen to your opinion also hope you will look up some of these passages which have mention to help understand what my argument be romans be what highly recommend get some rest
