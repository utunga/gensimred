whether your express your own view or that of the church's it's not applicable this be case of accept the lesser of two evils the girl could die along with the twin or the pregnancy could be terminate you and the church may feel that it's intolerable and equivalent to slavery or whatever but plenty of people can see that save the girl's life be worthwhile pursuit excommunicating the family and the doctor be just stupid

peta may have problems but if you're upvoting story from an artificial corporate-funded consumer advocate blog to the front page of reddit so do you
i'm curious how many redditors understand that corporations now use completely bogus consumer advocacy group judging from how often see disinformation/astroturf article on the front page not enough
you're not go to get the real data from lobbyist/pr firm that work for the corporations peta target
the people be corporations use euthanasia record newsflash people don't adopt adult cat and dog many of whom have behavioral problems and be dump on peta as the last in line of adoption attempt as public relations attack
judge the data not the messenger judge both
the facts have already be color by the messenger unwanted pet read abuse animals that now shit and piss everywhere and/or bite their owners be euthanized by the millions everywhere all the time this be not shock unless you live in cartoon corporation present it as shock through bogus consumer advocacy firm as part of broad effort to silence peta be somewhat important to consider as part of the broader conclusion unless you would like to avoid be rational and logical and take data present to you by corporate lobbyist to draw your conclusions without parse all the data first national shelter average the animal right record of the corporate sponsor of this hit piece petas explanation of the number the understand that peta is run end of the line humane euthanasia service not an adoption service etc
spend lot of my time write about these kind of disinformation efforts and modern propaganda in general fascinate me
oh get that don't debate that peta be hypocrite and have some idiotic tactics just point out that people's dislike of peta be be manipulate here by lobby operation that target all activism group and think people need to be aware of it the idea that end-of-the-line pet that get dump on peta by other adoption agencies get euthanized be not particularly shock really
believe in yes and no
sheer amusement
like most of these meter broadband push users should be able to log into the website to see their usage and how close they be to the cap
also keep in mind that this is still trial and they're proceed base on user feedback if you're in time warner cable market call or write them to complain may actually help
be careful though frontier have talk about impose 5gb per month cap on all of its tiers and currently they can barely offer more than 3mbps speed in many market
you're exactly right bandwidth and hardware cost be decrease this be about monetize and/or deter the use of internet video which of course be long term threat to their tv revenues yes cap impact only the heaviest users now but by impose them now before internet video really take off they can avoid become the dumb pipe
we need viable model to be able to support the infrastructure of the broadband business that suggest that flat-rate price combine with other revenue source like dns redirection advertise be not viable model can you perhaps show me where time warner cable ever operate at loss or even anything less than very healthy profit under the flat-rate price model
probably not and imagine that the trial be really be use to perfect the market message as to why this kind of money grab be necessary but keep in mind time warner cable so far isn't test this in market where there's an uncapped competitor so there be still hope raising stink with them may still help if you tell them you'll be leave to competitors even if you don't have one lie
time travel explain this somehow the statistical measurement be take in the future after we all click on prison planet to see what the fuck they be talk about
perhaps one reason for the abysmal recovery rate be because the court send so many people who don't want to stop drink know many in aa myself include who wish the court would not send people believe it's violation of one's right to be send to religious program that say i'm an athiest as be many many of my friends who be long-term sober and members of aa it's not bible-thumping environment generally and depend on where you go you can find group full of agnostics and non-believers though not whole lot there's definitely lot of bunk in the step but it's not all bunk making amend for past indiscretions can genuinely help people to mend their damage relationships there's plenty of bs but it's not all bad in the end while i'd fix bunch of stuff in aa still think it's better to have it available to those who want to go than to get rid of it
i've read all the orange-papers interest stuff as recall and some unsubstantiated rumor and over-generalization as well believe it have value as counterpoint to the bs in aa and the hero-worship bill receive here and there as cult take over people live it's not very effective there be no leader there's no money to be make the general downside for those who don't like it be the time waste listen to psychobabble always like that word and study bs theory write by long-dead snake-oil salesman then again many many people don't have anything better to do with their time other than get load so hang around aa even for what you list as bad reason be still good thing for some to me it's place to go and see friends and get remind of the mess make of my life and some of the psychological trick i've learn over time to distract myself from negative think or whatever you want to call it wrong think be punished--right think be as quickly reward prefect the menagerie
i'm not sure why you're be downvoted though i'd say the reason aa doesn't do science be because it's more like religion and rely on dogma not on research aa be not medical though i'm sure there be people in aa who think what they have be better than medicine
while aa doesn't claim to be religion it pretty much fit the bill in that it be generally center around purport belief in god whatever you call it there be court who see it as religion don't go say i'm part of religion but have hard time argue that aa be not religion i'll argue that it's not cult--though it might have be at one time
the picture need circle of pale white middle class over-privileged twenty and thirty somethings surround chewbacca sit in orange plastic chair with their pot belly gleam in the sunlight and their thumb up or down in affirmation and rejection and more lasers
an interest read give the substitution but the comparison doesn't hold up how many people do you know who be scientologists know zero--i believe because scientologists keep to themselves if scientology be on the cult scale let's put the peoples temple at 10 then aa be
don't see many people quote the bible in meet though sure there be plenty of christians in meet
love the amway comparison call it troll for newcomers remember read somewhere study probably bs but who know the purport that be sponsor be better for you than have sponsor ego suppose to get rid of it or fee it
be that reverence or adoration your attribute here
guess the reason bother to engage with the question be because believe in no god yet on occassion will pray if only to quiet the mind will recite the serenity prayer to nobody play psychological trick on myself which probably work less and less as time go by hence give your response still view no evidence of require worship in aa nor worship on my own part though may occassionally engage in ritual for ritual's sake
there be nothing to see here coordinated efforts at disinformation do not exist please return to your hot pocket and dancing with the stars
no don't ban scientology but absolutely take away their tax exempt status give they're for profit company

bond not my area but know the municipality work for do 30 year bond for capital improvement not say it's great idea but if they could prevent 3m/year in losses then it might be depend on the number

its slow but relatively recent development the idea come from good place book for example can have built-in audience so if they can make book into movie they can make comic if they can make comic they can make toy or brand into movie through recognition so why not stop at remake movies its recognize brand name with build in audience and from the studio/producer's standpoint they already have the right to the material so its no-brainer personally can't stand it but there's no way to fight then trend from within it will take audiences not go to the star trek movie to stop hollywood from make a-team the movie
having work for the company that make those amaze decisions can say it come specifically from the higher brass not recognize newer methods of gauge show's audience its frustrate and unfortunately its just the way hollywood work they need to see result maybe not after the first season but unless show can prove that the audience be grow its just easier to hedge their bet cancel the show and try the next thing i'll give you the short version its present viable business model to the content creators its one thing to watch show its another to pay revenue for it initially the logic behind hulu would be as place to get people interest in the show so that they would watch it through traditional methods there's no doubt that people be watch show in new different ways permanently but until standards for how that material be pay for be establish across the board then no major network/studio be go to get behind it that's rarely the case the general process for show be that single person or team create an idea that they sell to network now if the creator have experience as showrunner the day to day produce of the show if not they'll team the creators with season showrunner they'll create the pilot and if the pilot get pick up then they'll hire team of writers to do the bulk of the work ultimately the creator and showrunner have final say on each episode and most often will do the final punch up on each episode things can get green-lit before there's pilot base on an outstanding deal for example someone of joss whedon's caliber will create something amaze so the network or studio would have blind deal with them where they essentially agree to make whatever idea that creator come up with its very rare most time the network or studio execs will take look at the pilot script consider the talent behind it and see if it make sense to give it shoot hope this give you some answer feel free to ask away
out of college the money wasn't so bad but the hours be killer work at talent agency for long time and i'd have 12 hour days but the truth be that it be 24 hour days because i'd wake up go to work work 12 hours come home eat and go to sleep so can wake up hours later and do it again personally love movies can't see myself do anything else with my life besides this maybe later in life the money will be an issue but for now look at everything like an opportunity to learn but beyond actually learn how the job be do i've also meet people who will be part of my career for the rest of my life there's very few other industries that be like that i'd love to work as tv writer like the freedom of work as creative individual but like the structure environment of the writer's room but my experience on whole have be produce feature so more than likely i'll be work for this producer until can find job as junior executive somewhere else or get promote here
come to school in los angeles and every semester intern at different place eventually intern for talent agency when graduate end up work as an assistant to an agent and that's pretty much graduate school for hollywood its crash course in everything from learn the business to deal with crazy personalities and long contract after that transition to job work for producer and then another each time take on more and more responsibilities can tell you right now if you're interest the first thing you need to do be humble yourself you'll take lot of shit work long hours for little pay at the chance to maybe find good job somewhere where you'll get the chance to develop your own project and leverage your company's name to get something sell
ha actually the sad truth be that its lot like entourage except where nothing work out the way its suppose to there be essentially two type of producers line producers and creative producers line producers be below the line that mean they be consider part of the crew not talent they get pay relatively small amount but do the day to day produce of hire crew and find locations creative producers be above the line they're in the same category as directors and actors and usually make millions per project they usually be the ones that find the script attach the directors and sell it to the studio they then hire line producer to do the workhorse stuff there be wide range of producers i've work for someone who would just sell the project and then sit on their butt during production and collect check i've work for producers who be on set everyday and deal with every detail of get the movie make from secure locations to make sure the talent have the salad they want

guarantee you if you have really great idea and you write it out into well design script someone will make it don't think of it like you're compete against these remake the truth be lot of remake use the title or name of an old movie on top of new script the trickier part be get your work out to the right people the system be design so that its extremely difficult for people outside of the system to get their script look at producers won't look at script unless it be send from an agent or manager an agent won't look at script unless its send by manager or producer manager only want to sign people who have sell their script to producer or who have an agent but not manager but there be ways in usually it just involve get into the industry itself and find someone who will take the time to look at your script despite not have representation
have see ari emanuel couple time but have never formally meet him he's not nearly as zany as jeremy piven portray him lot of the ridiculousness that happen in the industry be when people with crazy personalities be give licence to act crazy to their assistant and the people around them simply because they're good at their job have plenty of stories but most of them be only funny because of the big name people involve and for the sake of have none of this come back to me i'll have to be vague on the specific name but work for producer who be ban from the set of his own movie for make the actors feel uncomfortable there be certain producer in town who have term in his deal with studio that assure his dog will be in every movie he make with them really good read if you subscribe to the wall street journal be this one about scott rudin http://online.wsj.com/article/0 sb112749746571150033 00 html mod home_page_one_us it'll really give you an idea of the shit assistants put up with
much more likely that they'll do sequel to the film serenity less of long term commitment on everyone's part but joss whedon be pretty busy with the day to day of dollhouse so basically if you want serenity to happen you'll have to stop watch dollhouse and hope that joss isn't feel creative enough to come up with new idea or to work on goner or cabin in the woods
creative but hand on producer so both although have people work below me who deal with the fun on-set stuff so part of my job be read the myriad of script that come in to see if any be worth pursue for the company
haha well i'd hate to say it but with fan like you whedon doesn't need enemies at the network actually truth be tell its those execs who get behind the idea that get the show start to begin with they're more often then not an equal creative force in show's development process that i'm sure they're just as dissappointed when they have to cancel show and start over
jon heder the fact that he have career be complete testament to the hard work of jared hess director of napoleon dynamite and heder's agent dave bugliari at caa and that's usually what it be someone be at the right place at the right time and be use as conduit for other people's project and labor yeap not really if anything you're more impress by the amount of work that go into create something that tug at an audiences emotion as kid have to leave the theater because ernest scared stupid film from 1991 scar me so much but that experience spark desire to learn how people create monsters and tension in movies so even though its terrible movie should thank it for make me want to make movies yeah mean couple things strike me if you've ever visit la you'll know that every bar and every restaurant be teem with good look but desperate people just want to make it as soon as they hear or think you might be in position to help them they quickly become the best waiter/bartender ever but the funniest story can think of be again at the agency agencies like most other hollywood company be pretty tight as far as security be concern the particular place work at you have to swipe card to get in pass two security welcome desks swipe card at the elevator and then know what floor you be go to this one time an unusual woman be wander our floor and have find her way to one of the biggest talent agent's offices the agent's assistant ask the woman if she be the masseuse the assistant be new believe her and let her through sure enough the woman be desperate to get her foot in the door and have walk in with her headshot actor's picture and resume and present herself as the next big thing unfortunately for her that particular agent be psychopath so the agent promptly have security throw her out and of course the assistant be fire within the hour as well so that assistant can thank that aspire actress amaze idea to break in for the reason they're unemployed
casting be actually pretty slow bore process and lot of cast be do below the radar but by and large the majority of cast directors be older women and gay men so think the traditional notion of what happen on cast couch isn't exactly true although can say that desperate actresses will do anything to get good representation and some of the old hollywood players like to indulge their misguide sense of success
nope there's pretty specific difference between the title and while i'm sure to someone outside of the industry the think of be someone's executive assistant for years on end doesn't sound like the ideal way to pursue career however in hollywood that's how its do every single person i've work for have at some point be someone else's assistant its how you learn the day to day of the job and it also create those interpersonal relationships that be the basis of job in the industry think i'm good at my job but its certainly not what i'm in for want to be the person who create the story that take people on an adventure outside of their normal live really can't think of any other industry where can do that and get pay for it too
inevitably if you want to work in film you'll have to come to los angeles its sad fact but every single company in town hire free labor we just call them intern but its great way in the door to figure out what you want to do it's more difficult to land an internship at the bigger place the studios/networks but there be literally thousands of smaller management or production company that hire people every semester if you're interest i'd recommend look for the uta joblist its an email list that go out every week list the available jobs and internships i'd also recommend http://www.entertainmentcareers.net other major cities to pursue entertainment job mostly because of productions there for tax incentives new york chicago atlanta vancouver and london
sadly no but oddly enough they provide full coverage for damage cause by lame insult
sadly have not read either of these book the trick be that if you capture the culture of hollywood at any give time you'll find its drastically different from the one that precede it can't even imagine how this business function before blackberry email or the internet but i've hear of enough stories from people who survive more hectic time in the industry to know that things be relatively tame and outsiders make it in the industry be less and less of reality actors be truely the worst compare to everyone else on the set they work the least amount of hours get the highest pay and have every comfort imaginable so its always unnerve to see them complain and blow up on set only because they're tell its okay to do if grip complain he have headache he'd be fire and that would be the end of it intern for temporarily unsuccessful manager who couldn't afford car insurance so he have me drive him to his meet one of which be on the disney lot however he tell me to stay in the park lot until the meet get out...it be and half our meet i've work mostly with writers and think it would astonish you to know how many mid-level no name writers have really come up with brilliant things that will never see the light of day due to bullshit factor there be too many to count but i'd say jason weiner be one of them
for production i'd stick with mandy.com its your best bet i'm sure you know this since you've go through school but the best way to do be get pa or 2nd ac job on local productions impress the hell out of the dp and stick with them from project to project don't know the market that well in new york but isn't the joke that everyone in there work on law and order at some point in their live
quotes be the business of talent agents for any amount they get pay by studio other studios and sometimes third party financier have to consider previous sum pay for older project so the longer an actor have be work the more likely it be that his quote be absurd granted people can and do reduce their quote but my guess be he get enough work to make drastic reduction in his price kind of pointless but i'm just speculate
not in million years but if it do happen my guess be reddit will know about it before do
assistant to producer assistant producer be title give on project basis for someone's involvement in the process often writers or studio executives who contribute to the project will be give an ap credit as form of acknowledgement producing credits mostly apply to feature tv be different producer creative producer exec producer studio exec or producer in name only line producer btl proder co-producer similar to associate producer but with more authority and often hire compensation associate producer
lloyd work for the head agent of his own company its safe to say many assistants aspire to be lloyd although he's be ari's assistant for way too long in the real world he'd be coordinator junior agent or fire by now
bingo that movie be about as close as you can get in fact little too close
its not unusual for production staff and writers to show up in scene or two for show they work for the office be one of those few exceptions where lot of the initial writers be also actors and the show be small enough that their cameos become more pronounce and show off their act chop bj novak in particular but its pretty rare...snl be probably the closest thing can think of
everyone literally everyone at some point in their career will be either typecast or hurt by their reputation eventually the desperation for money will come along and viola vin diesel the thing that you have to keep in mind be that for the most part all movies start out with good script or fun idea but its somewhere in the process that it become bad movie bad direction budget constraints poor cast so keep that in mind when vin diesel ruin wheelman
defer to david cross on all things desperate actor/la suck http://underthedog.com/tunes/live/david 20 cross-la 20 zona 20 rosa_austin 20 tx_5-23-2002/06-la.mp3
there's lot of bullshit to it ultimately it come down to one or two people's opinion on whether show stay on or not they'll refer to nielson rat ect and execs will make their case but its very finicky way to decide the fate of show it feel more like there should be board of directors decide
many time by other people but never tell i'll never work in this town again so guess that's good have see an assistant peg in the head with stapler before he's definitely not work since
again i'm speculate but tv work specifically cameos be great for actors who just need little cash most show shoot in la they only need them for short time and they get pay well also the trend in hollywood lately have be to attach big directors or producers with no name actors make up the price difference so big name actor can still use it for little boost with television as for why gary sinese be on csi ny...no idea probably favor and probably hard to find consistent work in new york just guess
its not easy there's always go to be assistant gigs open up but with the economy the way it be you're go up against people who have years of work behind them and be will to do it for less then they would have only few years ago the general advice be to come to la get job in the mailroom of talent agency work desk as an assistant and transition into what you want to do just know from firsthand experience the market suck and its tough to get in right now i'm from california but have never be to la until come out here for college that definitely help have three years more experience then people who come from boston or chicago but people in their late 20 come from grad school and end up intern at the same place do its just matter of prove who want it more and majority of the people who work in the industry be transplant in fact off the top of my head can only think of two people who be originally from la think that if you grow up here unless you're literally bear into it you kind of resent the industry so its the bright-eyed bushy tail kid from the midwest who end up become the big players
think they clearly have with show come back after be cancel but you can't justify new show base on the theoretical dvd sales so its tough decision think the slow trend will be to wait to see how dvds perform but i'm will to bet that they already have direct correlation to nielson rat so it might all be moot point baby boomer families in the midwest not hat just use as an example who have set hours for watch their nightly program who grow up with it and still even watch the commercials for their favorite drama or procedural still outweigh diehard fan of innovative content no matter how many dvds and bite of merchandise they buy and thus they dictate the market
boss-zilla by kate kelly and merissa marr september 24 2005 page a1 on his way out of the office for childhood friend's funeral last year 27 year-old jon silk scramble to handle one final task for his

produce my big fat greek wedding indeed the movie business be populate with successful rudin proteges include dreamworks skg production head adam goodman and craig perry producer of the american pie movies it's an unspoken quid pro quo the assistant dukes it out for six months or year and mr rudin open doors afterward attribute an enormous amount of whatever success i've be able to attain directly because of how saw him operate say mr perry does he yell sure do yell sure typically in their early 20 the assistants most of whom be men usually come directly from college some hail from top-tier institutions include duke johns hopkins and harvard but mr rudin isn't impress by fancy degrees the more money they grow up with the better the school the quicker they wash out he say some assistants have year or two of experience at production company in new york or l.a. but these days most be refer through an informal network of rudin alumni says one former staffer you get call from another assistant on friday afternoon say hey rudin just fire another assistant can you start monday most crucial be an ability to take heat from day one when mr evans be an l.a. base assistant in

rehired as many staffers be mr evans add pronunciation detail to stack of 500 flashcards he have already make with name and phone number of important rudin contact have to go back and make sure write down phonetically the difficult ones he say mr rudin say the flashcards be his idea you can't sound like you don't have clue who you're call he say he tell mr evans native of baldwin n.y. on long island mr rudin didn't attend college instead learn the industry under his own set of taskmasters he work for the late movie and tv producer edgar scherick who mr rudin say often complain he be surround by mediocrity as teen in the 1970 mr rudin work for broadway producers include the late kermit bloomgarden producer of death of salesman who instruct him to pick tomato bug off plant on his apartment terrace mr rudin say he be sometimes require to haul mr bloomgarden's false leg to harlem for repair on the bus since the producer wouldn't spring for cab fare whatever i've ask anybody to do i've never remove any of my limbs mr rudin say in business where rise cost and corporate consolidation have squeeze out many independent producers mr rudin put out as many as eight picture year

development include adaptations of the novel the corrections the pulitzer prize-winning the amazing adventures of kavalier amp clay and film about three mississippi boys who embark on shot-by-shot remake of raiders of the lost ark in the 1980
in rudin productions new york office near times square his time be surgically manage by five assistants who be classify by duty the executive assistant or no in rudin shorthand manage the schedule and travel with the boss that position the highest-paid be now hold by 22 year-old the second-ranking assistant occupy the hot seat man phone and help mr rudin hunt down people he want to speak with and

rudin want to attend show if he didn't show up the assistant could use them former assistants say they have handle chores such as return videotape drop off dry-cleaning and pick up rotisserie chicken but they can also find themselves in hollywood meet with the like of nicole kidman jude law or jim carrey for the hot-seat assistant the day start with 6:00 a.m run to mr rudin's apartment in the san remo build on manhattan's central park west where he live with his partner of seven years john barlow founder of new york public-relations firm that focus on broadway show there the aide retrieve the boss's list of outstanding phone call often 30 page long which mr rudin have annotate during the night given mr rudin's deal in london new york and los angeles call must be prioritize accord to time zone and urgency mr rudin usually arrive at work around 6:30 a.m at which time the hot-seat assistant begin dial his company have just 18 employees and since mr rudin involve himself in nearly every aspect of production from secure adaptation right to market the finish product the volume of call be heavy he say he make or receive about 400 in an average day mr rudin say he be regularly shock by the lack of cultural knowledge in his work force he once ask an assistant to get dvd of the 1952 film the member of the wedding but when he mention the name of the director the staffer didn't recognize it mr rudin say he ask the young man your parent pay for you to go to college and you don't know who fred zinnemann be mr zinnemann also direct oklahoma high noon and the day of the jackal the producer who once force an underling to tape sign define the word anticipate in huge letter above his desk say that when he ask follow-up question about work assistants often look back at him like i'm speak urdu he tell them when ask you these question have an answer ready then would think you're intelligent he be also know for wicked sense of humor when one assistant routinely sport ink-stained shirt pocket mr rudin buy him half-dozen expensive dress shirt at bergdorf goodman which he then have an intern spot with ink blotch the atmosphere drive assistants to perform remarkable task in may 2004 for instance director stephen daldry be climb in the himalayas when mr rudin become desperate to show him new screenplay after an assistant get the page into the director's hand in nepal mr daldry say he later ask mr rudin in amazement how do you find me an assistant get mr daldry's office to say where he be vacation then hire specialty courier service to take the script to kathmandu in 1992 l.a. base assistant adam schroeder be ask to deliver an offer to author terry mcmillan whose best-seller waiting to exhale be the subject of bid war mr schroeder say he fly to san francisco on the fourth of july then drive to her suburban home where she answer the door in bathrobe even after mr schroeder help the writer's little boy search for lose rabbit mr rudin didn't get the film right the loss didn't get mr schroeder fire he now operate his own production outfit in hollywood ms mcmillan decline to comment other time when things go wrong mr rudin let loose former assistants say he sometimes vent his anger by throw phone and office supply prompt assistants to take precautions some fear mr rudin might hurl an easily accessible frame picture on his desk so they surreptitiously move it out of his reach others measure mr rudin's phone cord so they could keep the appropriate distance the rookies often stand too close remember mr evans mr rudin say he's throw things occasionally but very rarely under such pressure assistants feel compel to push themselves connor price who be the no assistant for time last year spend sick day at home alternately vomit and give instructions to his co-workers until mr rudin finally tell them to stop call mr price might have have reason to be nervous shortly after be hire he come across note in which another assistant write to mr rudin regarding connor price know your first impressions weren't great in fact you call this guy an idiot adam rosenberg who spend six months work for mr rudin last year be petrify after the boss find fault with an art-journal piece he have translate from french mr rosenberg couldn't define what specific word mean in english what be you do don't want you mess around he say mr rudin reprimand he give me lecture about not pay attention to set things right mr rosenberg get to the office at 5:30 the next morning and call the article's french author for literal translation when mr rudin who doesn't speak french call in mr rosenberg recite the piece word-for-word he recall mr rudin's response ok follow by hang-up mr rudin say he do get point for speak french the prize for survive mr rudin's haze be first-hand education in be hollywood shark the producer for example try to make sure business associate owe him call rather than the other way around by have his assistants call contact at time when they're unlikely to answer leave message instead at one time terry press head of market at dreamworks have nighttime voicemail greet that say if you're anyone other than scott rudin's office please leave message we have be guilty of dump call occasionally mr rudin concede working for mr rudin also offer access to the sort of high-level hollywood executives unseen by most start assistants as young grunt work for the producer in the early 1990 brandon camp meet actor tim robbins and sherry lansing then paramount's studio chief he note mr rudin's knack for find movie fodder sometimes when still in manuscript form he'll say this book be go to be an incredible hit and everybody say well maybe'...and the book turn out to be the firm say mr camp the rudin-produced movie version of the john grisham thriller make more than 150 million at theu.s box office mr rudin credit his young staffers with provide him with some helpful tip years ago it be an assistant who first draw his attention to the below-the-radar movie bottle rocket the directorial debut of wes anderson now one of mr rudin's favorite creative mind you cannot overestimate the contribution that they make be 22 year-old guy who like movies and music and band he say mr rudin try to ease life for his staff with generous compensation and occasional gift it's bad enough i'm sure that they feel emotionally exploit he say don't want them to feel commercially exploit as well perks have range from the week-long nantucket vacation he purchase for onetime assistant kevin walsh to the mini cooper he give mark roybal former assistant soon to be name the company's president as wed gift rudin alums have powerful bond at mr roybal's wed two years ago 13 former assistants attend as well as the producer himself some have go into business together like movie producers lars knudsen and beau flynn once year derek skaletsky who work for mr rudin in the late 1990 and now work for children's haircut franchise near boston get together with half-dozen old rudin productions buddies for steak dinner everybody in hollywood try to be tough but not many people have the game say mr skaletsky rudin's get it
sadly very true it make sense all the writers on the show know the industry intimately and take from their real live the big difference be that everything always seem to work out for vinnie chase the reality be that that's rarely the case
for films time out of 10 the ap credit be for an assistant or underling who find the script its just nice way of repay them executive producers be the ones with big egos who need fill executive producers rarely earn their title its mostly monetary thing television ap be give to staff writer who have be around long enough and take more responsibilities in the day to day write process
because people go and see them and the studio make money just the way it be audiences be sheep all they need be shit blow up flashy advertise loud sound and bam what would be amaze be if people actually read review before see movies and dictate that intelligent innovative film get their ticket money
yeap so be vin diesel and hugh jackman
who you know 100 i'll reference an arrested development gag tobias create buzz around the water cooler tobias fünke that funke be some kind of something boy this funke be all anybody's ever talk about so sick and tire of hear about how brilliant that funke be overrated sadly this be how people get hire word of mouth
of course its stupid and honestly no one pirate movies as much as people in the film industry want to guess where all those oscar and post-production screeners come from i'm sure if you can come up with system that guarantee content providers get pay when people use their content then they'll support you but what drm and mpaa be do be the act of desperation they see their usual theatrical and home video sales go down and they can only point to piracy so until someone come up with better system netflix then this be what they'll do
my boss be no scott rudin both in good and bad respect but he certainly rely on myself and others at the company to bring ideas and script to him in most ways though i'd argue he's more hip than me i'm 24
well word it train me to know what to look out for and how to tailor to my audience the frustrate thing be that its easier to destroy than it be to create so unlike most of my colleagues try to give each script its fair due know its hard enough just to finish it let alone to get the courage to find an agent and get it to producer
no guidelines its all up to me if like something fight for it if think its terrible say so another sad little secret about the industry be that no one actually read anything the studio head the studio exec the producer be only read coverage synopsis and review of script usually 2-5 page usually write by an assistant an intern or hire reader only that coverage be ever look out so its very likely that the movies you be watch start when an unpaid intern sit in cramp office somewhere in the valley like script and write glow review lot of producers like to specialize in certain genres but lot be just on the lookout for whatever they know can sell actually big business be just sell spec script that never actually get make zach helm actually be succesful writer who have never write anything that get make that be of course until he write his manifesto http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/03/windolf200603
i'm talk mostly about directors/writers actors be another game entirely the best bet director have be to make something cheap that be hit on the festival circuit that'll usually get the attention of agents at least until the heat wheres off the tricky thing to do be to easily and quickly make that transition from an indie director to one who can work in the studiosystem lot of good talent aren't really prepare for the barrage of attention one of the best advice ever get as director be to always have an opinion when you walk into those meet at the studio they won't care if you like their project or not they just want to believe you know how to make it better writers be sort of crapshoot lot of writers make it by submit to screenwriting contest and some assistant somewhere will get hold of the winners and get manager interest but by and large the majority of represent writers will make their in by write an amaze script and have someone pass it along to manager who will take chance on it the way the system be set up be that its insulate for example if someone write script and call an agent and say read my script and the script suck which 99 do then the agent waste his time but if third party manager send the script and the script suck then that agent will know not to trust that manager the next time around but obviously writer will always think be own material be amaze so as frustrate as the system be its also necessity if writing/directing be what you want to do then do it write...direct do it on your free time eventually if what you make be good enough someone will see the potential in it don't try write one thing and bang on every door in hollywood its waste of everyone's time don't be this guy http://www.everyonewhosanyone.com
work for far more terrible and demand organization http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/creative_artists_agency
i'm hopeful its the latter but honestly luck have lot to do with it
keep write and keep apply to fellowships there's no magic trick to it the ideal job for you would be an assistant in the writer's room of new show those be hard to come by but if you're fortunate enough to be in los angeles there's always someone who you can talk to about intern somewhere to get you close to that spot
depends on the movie if its tentpole big studio picture they're clearly not go to give it to kid fresh out of filmschool but if that kid make something really interest that get lot of attention at festivals then he might be consider for something that have low budget the thing that they really have to do be wow the studio execs in meet they basically pit directors against one another and pick the one they feel be best suit to the job that include price experience and vision for the movie
because people go and see it the trend be really just try to get the right to brand name and then make movie work around that if you don't want it to happen stop see these kind of movies and stop your friends too
honestly don't have the highest respect for actors writers do wish could name specific name but i'm nervous about that but sometimes you'll talk to someone who should be the biggest asshole but they arn't the most talented people don't let it get to their head they're perfectly accessible to nobodies and the head of studios its the best quality to have in this industry
sorry the show didn't work out i've live here on permanent basis and never stay at hotel in that part of town let me think about it google be probably your best bet
that's good point let me hack the mainframe and get you an answer my guess be that hollywood's history with military consultants go back aways so those relationships be already there whereas technology be always accessible to laymen so anyone think they can be an expert on the subject
that's always be the case for as long as network have be around what change be the argument for how they determine show's success ie cult following dvd sales tivo
the straightest man alive
sorry boss i'll get back to work and you can get back to make reddit user account on set while you're suppose to be make movies
can't really say if you've ever be to la its pretty intimidate to see how many scientology center there be around town then again use to live next to the biggest one in hollywood and always find it odd that they have their own security/police guard the area but who be to complain be able to walk the streets and buy my drug without fear of get jump while in the shadow of that eight side scientology cross
while have see plenty in my time gotta frankly say that hollywood or at least the side have see have be strangely devoid of it corporate culture have change since the days of don simpson http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/don_simpson
again don't know enough about the specifics of certain actors but guarantee it come down to money television actors can make decent money and depend on person's career their interest and how desperate they be for cash tv show role recur or not can make sense and the more and more actors do it the more common it will be can only guess that trend aside big television show have the money that's comparable to what these actors would make in film
seinfeld and frasier arn't the ideal examples frasier as you remember be spinoff so immediately it have build in audience that the network could stand behind luckily the show take off seinfeld be widly different show then the program around it from the pilot alone you either get the show or you didn't i'd agree that network would benefit from have show on the air longer and sometimes they be til death be an example of show that shouldn't have be on the air as long as it be but ultimately that decision of whether to green light or cancel show be what make or break network executive think the internet follow be something that would not have be there for the traditional purely television format so it help always sunny be show that have definitely stay alive and prosper due to their internet follow but the executives at fx have have see that after their rat initially suck
they've stay pretty much consistent runtime of around hours and 30 minutes http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2009-02-23-oscar-telecast-comparison_n.htm but sure if ever get invite to attend i'll punch the whole crew for you
http://www.hotelamarano.com
yeap pretty accurate in fact there be an agent work with who also would do cameos in various episodes so i'd see this agent at work go home turn on the entourage and see him play caricature of himself on tv
they definitely do netflix be definitely change how networks/studios distribute media and likewise they'll tailor their media to fit the medium i've speculate elsewhere that its just the culture of hedge bet and cancel show ultimately someone's career rely on those decisions and any show have the potential to have very dedicate cult follow but if it isn't enough to entice advertisers then there's simply no way around it at least use the traditional tv model
its pretty standard fact that every script from its initial spec draft go through bunch of rewrite at the discretion of the studio occasionally if the director on the project have history of write he'll be give the final pass so yes script do often fall apart at the hand of studio executives who be tell it's there job to make change to the script until they're happy but lot can go wrong in production too just again keep in mind every movie at one point be an idea sooo good that they put millions of dollars behind it
not me i'm sorry think he hasn't be in anything good since boiler room
this definitely play part studios want to know that their directors will deliver the film they pitch under budget and on time but in the room they want to believe that this director understand the film better then they do keep in mind they be the ones that buy it so you as director need to convince them that you have the best vision for the film but again they're not go to meet with you unless they have that sample that suggest you're the right guy
these be all estimate assistants can make 20-70 year lifers maybe can break six digits studio execs range from 60-300 agents make base of 50-200 with huge bonuses per deal do writers can make scale http://www.wga.org/uploadedfiles/writers_resources/contracts/min2008.pdf but the good ones can make hundreds of thousands even millions per project producers directors and actors make crazy amount depend on who they be
stunts be probably the one aspect of the industry know nothing about but give your family's history imagine they have contact at some stunt house somewhere who could take you on as an intern consider maybe attend one of these to make initial contact http://www.actionfilmworkshops.com
don't really agree with that statement think the trend lately be for upcoming foreign film directors commercial and music video directors be very popular in the late 80 and 90 because it allow for them to hone their craft and specific style this lead to good sample and experience to bring to the table when they finally make the transition to feature directors but in the next 3-5 years expect huge influx of eastern european asian and south american directors who specialize in cheap realistic special effect become the norm
credits be big deal they're write into contract and negotiate its very difficult to get the final card the and edward norton usually the first bill actor get there own card and then less important people share card but intro logo's be break down like this studio/final financier if purchased after festival run main producer's production company or original financier 2nd production company usually an actors production company or rights holders 3rd production company director or actor's company its just matter of distribute credit amongst those involve in bring the project together its myth that the vision of project fall solely on the director or the writer or producer it truly be collaborative process technically its the producer who select the director so the director will always back down to what the producer want the separation lie between final cut only in extremely rare circumstances will the director or producer have final cut over the studio
agents be regulate by the state they can only make 10 and they cannot produce their clients project agents usually have upwards of 30-50 clients managers be not regulate they can make anywhere from 20 depend on their arrangement they can produce their clients project they usually have more manageable client load of 10-20 entertainment attorneys be regulate they can only make they often have 50-100 clients as they're only use during negotiations talent can survive with just and agent or manager/attorney combo more often the not they have all three rarely some only have an attorney but these be the most seek after people
its not hard land on set as pa grips camera assistants ect be all union control so its best to try to land couple pa job to see what it be that really interest you you do not do not have to go to film school to get job in hollywood do but assure you there be nothing learn in classroom that couldn't have figure out by be on set just show up and learn its very hand on sort of industry where you only learn by do it grip set up light per the director of photography's direction see below http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/143794/movie_set_terminology_film_crew_jobs.html
to play devil's advocate let say make movie and put it on youtube there's no doubt that it'll get widely see which be great for me as an artist but let assume pay for that movie out of my pocket then i'm shit out of lot of money movies be expensive however if hand out copy of the movie on dvd and know that people be pay me directly for my content then i'll have the money to do it again now for band its simple you distribute your music widely so you have fan base then you play show and sell merchandise to make your money its win-win but there's no equivalent for filmmakers either they sell their film to distributer or the share it freely and don't make any money think subscription service like netflix or an advertisement base one like hulu be as close as its go to get for widely distribute films/tv without break the bank through the process and know personally lot of people prefer to watch movies in cinema experience which be why think the theater option will always be possibility
wish there be simple formula to determine show's longevity but its up to people to pick the show create show and eventually cancel the show and humans be quite fallible
agree and think that eventually something will get work out you can't deny there's base for content deliver online just fundamentally don't see version of it where the content be simply free films and television show be usually way too expensive to make purely for arts sake
agreed have you get much work now as director or be you still do 2nd unit stuff
again get nervous about name specific name and for the most part the majority of actors be decent normal people who be just do their job its certain people who take too much liberty with their position and throw it around
personally prefer the bbc model for show which seem to generally have show run for 2-4 season max don't know if this be just trend in lot of my favorite show or genuine rule but think it force the creators to be clever about the storylines and prevent show from run past their prime it also set the stage for lot of new ideas to find time each season
sorry if that's not what you want to hear but its the truth you cant just show up at studio and convince them you're amaze you'll need something viable to prove it and unlike any other aspect of the industry you're almost guarantee attention if you do well at any of the major festivals or if you do something unique on the internet that bring alot of attention the guy who direct the texting while drive psa be pretty big this week who know he could parlay it into studio gig
just google that huh really don't know my guess be as good as yours http://www.youtube.com/watch xp8ic4-x_qg if you think of anything non-piven relate let me know

there's simply no easy answer like anything else in this world as long as you believe in what you're do and be will to face regection for years without hope of success then you've get shoot in general actors with specific look seem to do better than those who don't work for cast agency for short while and that really be just pure crapshoot again per david cross right now there be million people in la who be all go to make it...maybe 13 be actually go to make it 14 if you count the girl who go on blinddate then pose for hustler if that's your idea of make it then yeah let juice that up to 14
very serious
all hollywood company hire intern without question to their experience special effect house be much more accessible than act they'll take you in and teach you their craft its definitely good in and fortunately special effect house be locate all over the world so you don't necessarily have to be in los angeles
we don't really run in the same circle but if see him i'll say this be for one time and he'll be confuse which will make the bash easier
nope not until you find consistent work lot of it be pay out of your own pocket or borrow from friends and family but the more you do the more experience you'll have and the better you'll be at do it for live while don't really care for him as director respect him as filmmaker i'd recommend you read robert rodriguez's book for inspiration http://www.amazon.com/rebel-without-crew-23-year-old-filmmaker/dp/0452271878
was it the the graciela burbank its now call the hotel amarano http://www.hotelamarano.com
really never understand the fixation with the cast couch something about desperation in people guess
dvd sales b-movies or rather what we think of as b-movies and not actually b-movies from the 70 that be use as filler inbetween studio movies have an extremely viable market in dvd sales blockbuster have ton of arrangements with financier who back film for usually around 1-2 million and can guarantee themselves profit from the dvd arrangements napoleon dynamite be one such example of success story the producers raise million dollars from various financier they spend 500 on napoleon dynamite but to assure their backers would get return they keep the other 500 with the intention of make straight to dvd horror movie that they know they could make 1million back fortunately napoleon be hit and they never have to make the horror movie
best of luck to you hopefully will cross paths at some point
sorry it work for me maybe http://kiwi6.com/file id x0i364ra
http://www.deadline.com/hollywood/ed-norton-and-marvel-in-a-hulk-ing-feud ed norton marvel final cut debacle and just for kick tony kaye who direct ed norton in american history have similar experience http://www.filmvault.com/filmvault/nash/a/americanhistoryx1.html
nope studios and financier cough up cash i've break down the difference somewhere else here but basically feature creative producer package material find the script attach director and talent and then sell it to the studio and then try to make sure the film come in as ask by the studio the line producer have to secure locations and crew and budget the film they deal with the day to day problems of production permit right ect
and like mention that's an extremely rare scenario give up final cut be akin to surgeon give the patient the scalpel only the very best could truly know how to edit themselves better then professional
nope just prick who make lot of money close deal
its kind of ironic but the price increase while complete bullshit in la its 14 for theater ticket the price difference be mean to represent the revenue lose to piracy which be sadly the case
no problem
haha i'd say all of the above usually feature productions be all plan out and set up for way in advance but ultimately things go haywire and production become grueling experience but the fun thing be that you know there's an end point and everyone work together until they get the shoot off there's something reward about contribute one small part to large production know that without you it couldn't have happen the unions have set hours to force major productions to try not to run late as they have tendency to do so often when location or person be unavailable after certain day then people be often ask to work 16-20 hours to get the shoot off the result be unfortunately high number of car accidents for crew who nod off while drive home but i'd say for the most part its fun communal experience
nope before lumberg's time on the show
you're welcome if anything come to mind i'm still check in
there be number of agencies in la that specialize in non-union extras you sign up their automate message will let you know where you need to show up the next day and there you will sit for 10-12 hours move or stand as need sound fun http://www.centralcasting.org
not yet although have work on movie that be about the porn industry and we hire former porn star and shoot at mansion where porn have be shoot so essentially we make porn without sex
you're put the cart before the horse write the show first then try to find someone to produce it if you can't find anyone to produce it and you really believe in the project then you'll just have to find the finance credit cards/loan its how lot of success stories start jon favreau kevin smith and robert rodriguez come to mind
no that's too optimistic it's more like stumble across this http://www.cinemablend.com/new/view-master-the-movie-13820.html and then you realize they're seriously go to make view master the movie and you die little inside
thanks chyndonax let me know if you think of anything
think its because of two fundamentally different creative process games be mean to be world create and entertain for 72 hours where as film be design to tell story in unique world for hours plus there's always gap between the creative people who come up with the videogame and their counterpart who have to deliver solid idea base on the material to studio who have their own vision of what the videogame base movie should be
personally i'm big fan of foreign film in general my experience with other industries have be pretty minimal american productions often shoot up in canada vancouver for tax rebate i've visit fox studios in sydney and it be ghost town the aus to us dollar isn't really favorable to productions right now as for the rest of the world's film business must admit i'm pretty clueless one of the fascinate things about european filmmaking be the fact that most countries provide film fund to help develop local film which obviously be counter measure to combat hollywood but its fascinate to think that government would take time to finance film its such crazy concept here in the state
awkward since both usually take place in bathroom of some cramp club
no problem
good point guess mean to say its great that they get the opportunity to make whatever they want next
the documentary genre have be around as long as film have the earliest film focus on people's fascination with movement human culture and world travel the only recent development have be the blockbuster documentary which be heavily advertise docs that revolve around central character moore gore or morgan freeman's voice but the recent political-squed ones moore gore tend to focus less on an omniscient narrator discuss broad unarguable facts to load conversation its still interest and great that non-fiction have prove profitable but still you need to be wary of theater go trend in general when time be bad war economy people flock to fictional escapism when things be relatively calm non-fiction seem to find its way to the forefront i'd say we're due for plenty more escapism
thanks pretty much would have do the same thing ace be the editors guild there's guild for every major union sag/aftra for actors dga for directors wga for writers pga for producers http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:entertainment_industry_unions
honestly no this be the one thing i'm sure want to do more so than anything else what specifically will be do in the industry be open to debate but love the idea of take people away from their worlds too much not to do this
deal
like any job its something people fall into it take certain quality to be able to meet someone and categorize what their look be so that later you can reference them essentially cast director will be give list of roles to cast and will have to use information from the script to decide who would be ideal then to see what the price range be and consider options for who would work best this include every speak role in the film its process that involve work as an assistant at cast company and familiarize yourself with the up and come face of which there be hundreds if not thousands for any give look
well can't speak to the phrase per-say however have have close friends who do do the extra thing for quite sometime and you'll definitely have stories there be some crazy people who do background work the other side of background work be see how people try to break in one of the most desirable things to attain as non-union extra be sag card collect three sag card and you can join the union however get sag card be difficult and sometimes painful process but its certainly worth pursue if you have free time and some some extra cash
slip mean sag voucher know there be certain loopholes to the system for all sag signatories ie any major studio if character speak then they must be union so if someone have speak line then the studio must sponser their union application so they don't get fin for use non-union actor so more often then not when extras be see talk in movies/tv they're actually just move their mouth if they utter word it can become problem another thing be if background player become central figure in scene this might happen while on set either because an actor doesn't show look the part or the director just want to try the scene different way find this link it have more information http://www.hollywoodaccess.com/sag.htm
internet/digital distribution be great for artists its great way to get your work out to the mass quickly but as viable business model just don't see it if mst3k be brand new youtube sensation then where would the money go to fund the show and more importantly obtain the right to the film they use in the show think that hulu/netflix be an ideal method of distribution however unlike the traditional method of television program where audiences be introduce to new show simply by be on before or after popular show how exactly will network get people interest in new show if they can only watch specifically the content they pay for
might also be another exception but both of these be before he define his action career as chronicle of riddick triple and fast and furious
there's no easy answer its complicate problem and media conglomerate be usually the last to jump on board something fully until all the kink have be work out that be say you might like boldly go nowhere its new show from the creators behind always sunny in philadelphia its parody of 1970 sci-fi show its very much in the vein of mst3k and it'll hopefully be out next season perhaps on hulu/netflix/youtube
not really my background be mostly with directors/writers but anyone worth damn wouldn't need to use system like that they'll usually have their own catalogue suspect that service like talenthunter just take money from desperate actors with no real expectation of their service be widely use in the industry
casablanca children of men leon eternal sunshine of the spotless mind groundhog day be just few that come to mind dexter the wire always sunny in philadelphia curb your enthusiasm
think that personally there be certain contingent of people who prefer to watch movies in theater set but it would be stupid to ignore the grow trend for people who prefer to watch movies in the comfort of their home so while think technology and business model will shift to allow people to watch movies instantly at their home their will always be model for people to watch things in the theater but aside from have filmmakers tour the country sell dvds shirt and book about the movie at every single screen then there's no way to use the concert method as similar example
no he just get pidgeon hole into make those kind of movies so unless you need someone to blow up car and jason statham isn't available you use vin
be just in an ed norton frame of mind but yeah he's get reputation for be control read those two article for context
there be similar racket for writers there be online screenwriting contest which cost 30-100 dollars per submission and they guarantee your script will be review by an industry professional the truth be couple assistants will flip through it and collect check themselves another similiar scam be these things call pitchfests where writers pay crazy amount to come pitch industry professionals again its usually assistants who sit at desk for hours on end listen to desperate writers nod their head and collect check i'd say if you really want to pursue act try your best to stand out in your hometown and if you really believe in yourself then you'll just need to make the move to big town ny chicago or la
not like my taste be any more weight or give any extra insight because film be my career
it have lot to do with the foresight of their agents if they're able to chart career path that match high salary with oscar worthy performances then they have shoot but if that agent be just focus on turn their client into the big action star and only take the franchise big budget picture then sure enough they will be define by that
the best agents make their clients feel like any career choices be really their ideas the best talent agents ari emanuel ed limato and bryan lourd
if you're serious and in la can try to set you up with an internship
you've get misguide grasp of the peck order on set the assistant director or ad be arguably the most important person on set they literally control everything schedule who go where when people can break and what go on when although an assistant to producer doesn't command that same respect one would be foolish to piss off the assistant to the most powerful guy on set
there's also some good ones out there just luck land in the right place
my guess be it be probably just pa or at best 2nd ad which be an assistant to the ad
think more likely this type of language will be the norm and use traditional english will be think of as pompous and faggy

consider no qualified health benefits plan ombudsman this person or office would be charge with help people navigate the new health reform system and report to congress on recommendations for improvements in administration of the program it's part of the health choices administration no on the list that sound like double-counting to us and that's true of number of other items on the list as well four of the items on the list include the creation of various trust fund these be new fund but they be to be create by exist agencies these be essentially bank account those aren't new government bureaucracies in our book the list also include six pilot program and three demonstration program the list also include three new ombudsmen and special inspector general for the health insurance exchange three items on the list deal with comparative effectiveness research although the government already do such research we think it's fair to count the creation of new center for comparative effectiveness research on the list but the next two items comparative effectiveness research commission and patient ombudsman for comparative effectiveness research seem like triple-dipping that's 20 that they debunk but its stan dorn who suggest its actually 36 but the other 16 be not specifically break down
there be music supervisors for any give production generally for television its do by the network for feature its do by studio often the creative talent involve can suggest song choices but its really up to the music departments to find the best music that fit the give subject and its up to them to acquire the right it's not an area of expertise i'd check with joe escalante http://www.barelylegalradio.com

let me introduce you to the concept of hypocrisy it be an unfortunate dimension of the human condition doubly so for republicans quadruply so for the god-fearing right it's the amaze ability to force your beliefs on others without the nag concern to live by those beliefs or to truly consider the grander cost of the implementation and upkeep of those belief systems in you know...the real world

but it do suggest that lenders and loan servicers take step to screen and identify strategic defaulters in advance and possibly avoid offer them loan modifications since they'll probably just re-default on them anyway what load of crap if they have modify my mortgage as request wouldn't ever be look at walk away as it be offer to pay off principal at lower rate and they say no--dumb-asses so i'm walk away they can eat the two hundred grand loss fuck them
djhwilliams do know of aftrs but think might be one of the few here in hollywood that do the reason know of aftrs be that actually work on student film there while visit few years ago its great program and it's very much unlike anything in the united states its difficult program to get into think its like people accept per semester and generally they expect you to have plenty of industry experience under your belt before you can apply however if you do get in you'll be able to work on short fund by the school directly which as mention be unlike anything we do over here stateside also north ryde be close enough to sydney to make it worth your while if you're not local cheers

note to self log of computer when go to work okay the guy's bite loopy in my book as well but he's definitely get right to privacy and his wife probably should have respect that right scat be gross just make sure that be print by my name
have great sex life with my wife--who love and have no intention of ever screw other women in the ass--but if my wife knew would want to do that she might not be so happy that be completely normal--to keep things from your wife that she might not think be such great ideas
will agree with most of what you have write however other than the hit on foreign student there's no evidence that what the husband have write be day to day thing drive his exist sex life it could be fantasy world think his fantasize about degrade women be sad and sick but if it's just fantasy never act upon and his marry life be otherwise normal as it seem to have be for seven years don't think the wife do anything more than invade his privacy
think bill be funny--i think michael be heartwarming in his naivete think rush be fuck prick and strangely enough think ann have fantasit comic time though think she's fuck bitch since we're discuss everyone
4000 post definitely sound like lot--but over what period of time he could be whip out 10 in ten minutes--if so then ten minutes day for little over year be the 4000 more likely it's over longer period of time point be their relationship appear to have be work sure the guy sound like creep--but all men be in some way deep down i'll give five to one you're woman certainly could be wrong
if it work then it work people can go their whole live without share some things with those closest to them that doesn't mean the relationship doesn't work just because you think it's important to share everything men and women have different conceptions as to the importance of various things in relationship it's just fact if you think you know everything about what your husband think and feel you're kid yourself
i'm not sure what you mean by lot think i'm talk about one concept--one you clearly think be important as do the wife in this case you say it's not important that they share everything but you definitely want to approve of everything not shared--or you wouldn't be take this course my point be if you don't know about it it doesn't matter
yes it's pretty black and white--if the wife didn't know about his internet usage or his fantasy she wouldn't care and it apparently hasn't hurt them up to now

good use of the ad pilot
can't fuck stand to listen to listen to that fuck any more what the fuck be he do on television fuck asshole bill o-crap-head-reilly
since we allow about trillion gallons of water to go out under the golden gate every year to support salmon run couple hundred million gallons for pot seem pretty reasonable to me then again i'd be shock if you could get that much water to plantations your try to hide
clearly you don't know what the fuck you're talk about california have the about the smallest per-person government of any state
how many government workers per capita do utah have tax revenue per capita do not necessarily equal state workers also in direct cost cost of live in california be go to be higher also grab data after the fact to back up position be not evidence of know what you be talk about--especially when your evidence be not to the point
thank you for point out my mistake be california state worker and we have waste here however have be in the military and have work private sectar as well and know there be waste everywhere stand by my assertion that california state government be more efficient than most--see here http://www.ccsce.com/pdf/numbers-oct08-govt-employees.pdf on thing remember tell people five years ago when couldn't find any good job applicants i'm an engineer with staff be that when the economy be good nobody want to work here because our pay be mediocre and there be no chance of hit it big i.e bonuses/raises and when time be tough everyone want to work here be surprise at the backlash we receive now--but i'm more surprise at the lack of knowledge display by those attackers perhaps you pass up state job five years ago and be now piss
guess be annoy at the attack we receive our pay have be cut 15 this year for the entire decade of the 90 we receive like total in raise while the outside world of engineer get like 40-50 that get pretty old at that point do work pretty hard now i'm somewhat redundant turn into that bad-attitude state-worker hat when be young but my spend meet my income so that 15 cut do make things stressful it's one thing to take job know your economy dependent but at the state we sacrifice opportunity maybe because we're lazy for security oh well that's go too no worries--we'll survive
no worry i'm give house back to the bank now but i'll survive have another smaller one to move in to i'll grant that the argument can be make that state workers can be inefficient but since there's no profit motive and no profit give to stakeholders it's about the same as if the private sectar do this work be surprise at the third the first be like oh well and the second be oh shit things will be tight the third be well bad
could have keep the house but wouldn't have be able to keep up with the credit card bill figure could walk away from the house with impunity but not the credit card as have another house to move to the choice seem obvious to me i'm okay with it it's only hard when think of all the work do on that house over the years oh well have to do analysis base on the future not the past motivation at work be fluid like the good feel of get something do but there be no real downside to get distract our system do have problems in that lazy/useless people be rarely discipline because it's such pain for the supervisor but the net effect to our clients the taxpayers be negligible the money that's lose in laziness be more than counterbalance by the greed of the private sectar i've work with enough private engineer over the years to know that they have deadwood and incompetence in their rank as well but when you're work in the gray areas of opinion you can't be accuse of incompetence

fuck that make me laugh out loud not belly laugh but still well worth feel

think the point of the quote be that nuclear weapons for all be as stupid as gun for all even if all but felons own gun it would be much less safe than it be now because it would be even easier for them to obtain them regard the fact you know several people who put food on the table with guns--who give shit they don't need to it's hugely unlikely any substantial percent of their intake calories need to be kill by gun it's bullshit
the rose by bette midler
just like in afghanistan where all the males own gun nobody ever get fuck shoot bullshit abundance of weapons do not make anything safer the reason the us have use the nuclear bomb wasn't because they be the only ones to have it--they use to avoid kill million people on an invasion and because they have spend two billion 1945 dollars develop the fuck thing
don't object to those people put food on their table or keep that gun--i object to them insist that almost everyone should have gun or at least have the right to the gun wide proliferation of these gun do not serve any purpose relate to the original mean of the 2nd amendment and don't try to convince me that it do it only serve to make our live less safe and keep your fuck up quote about safety and liberty right up your ass where it belong please the point be that time have change and wide proliferation of gun be not necessary for most americans today--and believe most shouldn't have them have friend who's son be shoot in the face by the ex-husband of his girlfriend--don't tell me wide proliferation of cheap and easily accessible gun doesn't affect me it affect us all tangentially keep hunt rifle or two license and secure for your personal use--just quit insist everyone in my subdivision have the right to one it wouldn't affect your life at all if you have just one or two gun
wonder if people can learn to shoot heroin like gentleman give practice and moderation
don't honestly believe in completely ban gun have make no detail thoughts on exactly what policy should be and really don't care to think easy access to gun be bad policy don't think the found father would have envision today's situation hence don't think the more popular amongst the the gun crowd interpretations of the 2nd amendment apply that's my opinion and hell if it be explicit as if they envision the gun nut in my build as the militia then i'd think it need to be repeal one other thing since you have different motivation than i--i don't believe that the ones who have go through emotional upheaval should be the ones make policy don't think victims of abuse should be on jury--and don't think you be victim of tragedy be good candidate to make gun policy for the rest of us your story be sad one and think you should have the right give proper training/background check to carry firearm--but don't think you should force your view on others either good luck
have be sober in aa for over 13 years have be an atheist all along and maybe because i'm in the us do see quite few jesus-people in meet it's plain to see that they believe that the higher power of aa be thin veil disguise the christian god so people will have an easier time come to god would ask for citation for your suggestion that it have be scientifically prove that aa be genetic certainly alcohol abuse may be pass down because kid mimic their parent doubt that the alcoholism gene have be find or that it even exist in fact alcoholism or whatever you want to call it--i almost prefer asshole-ism be so prevalent that there could be any number of reason why nobody choose to be an alcoholic just as nobody choose to be an asshole--some of us just be and do believe that practice of the 12 step can help one overcome some of that asshole-ed-ness that consume us and coincidentally help with the whole alcohol problem aa dogma state lot about alcoholism which it never could and cannot now back up just parrot the bs that bill wilson make up might make us feel good in meet and it might lure others into the cult but it's not correct you yourself direly want to explain away your atheism in aa by call it belief in something else--but face it bill wilson espouse belief in supernatural god and he believe in an alcoholism that be just as fake let the scientists study what there be to learn about alcoholist--and when we can we can spread the truth the useful part of aa to those who can benefit
you actually don't understand my beliefs--i could give shit what the found father would have think with respect to various items they couldn't have conceived--nuclear arm stem cells assault weapons indeed what they themselves think on some matter clearly don't agree with period--they certainly think free men mean only free white men--not women not black hell probably not even non-land-owners there be certainly dissention among the found father on some ideas you can pick and choose all the old quote you want but it doesn't affect my feel about what the second amendment mean to us today even if there be enough people have no idea if there be who agree with change the 2nd amendment to clarify certain point such as what militia mean it would never be change because of our system--hence have little respect for it's application
don't know if there be an official policy i'm wonder if care enough to ask wonder if i'd be more likely to ask if they be christian because i'd be less likely to be brand racist or prejudice if complain about christians another fanatical atheist
be there like whole slew of people who don't read things try read again--i never say pakistan be in the middle east
not hospital--many large work place have lay-down room for the women with cramp ask the women in your workplace if you work in large office
asking muslim not to pray at work be not the same as ask someone to eat pork certainly they can leave the build to pray if they choose to use their personal time to pray as have say the guy who pray in his office never cause me to think second think if those guy be in there pray on regular basis and you have cramp would you go in there
their prayers don't bother me as say the old pakistani guy never bother me--but he's in his own space pray at work if they pray in their own cubicles think would just ignore it--it wouldn't bother me
i'm atheist and i'm not sure that have anything to do with it heck i'm sure can find theists here who would feel similarly
hmmm yes if don't know about it and it doesn't affect me why would have feel about it that's part of why ask the question the only reason know they be pray be because be walk down the hall and you can see the floor in that room through the blind could see one of them kneel on his blanket they they come out of the room carry their blanket few second later as be still in the hall think just don't like the use of the common area at work for religious activities don't think i'd care if they be in their cubicles if be woman would probably bitch about it--but i'm not
yeah--i don't set the policy hell don't even know what the policy be for years the cot room be off of the women's bathroom and couple of years ago they remodel and put the door off the main hall
i'll still disagree that ask them not to use the common area at work to pray be not the same as ask jew to eat pork the muslim can pray in his cubicle or leave the build in fact think pray alone be fine--there have be case of senior personnel in our build hold christian prayer meet in their offices and they be tell to cut it out--though because they be senior and there could be complaint about preferential treatment
i'd prefer no prayer room be assign why should the company waste resources on group that don't include me i'm an atheist
thank you for your calm response to my quickly word rant i'll review what write for clarity
re-read my rant i'm wonder where the five logical fallacies be please let me know the first i'm say the found father clearly be not envision all the black chinese atheists women and mexicans own gun they envision small percentage of society own gun for the protection of society you're not disagree with that you're ignore that i'm say don't agree with what many in the us interpret as the protections of the 2nd amendment agree the us supreme court have weigh in on this issue--and that's the final legal word nothing can do about that
whoah you think if we don't provide prayer room for muslims here we'll lose pool of candidates i'll have to disagree with you if devout muslims represent large percentage of the applicants it might be something to consider but it's not religious tolerance in the workplace need not include provide prayer area for every subgroup who want to pray the fact that it's just one mean nothing
haven't state as much but if you read article of problems with this in great britain think you'll see it didnt start as monopoly there either--yet they have problems with competition for the open space when it get to that point think it's already go too far would just prefer them not use the common areas at all for their religious need
my company have hire many many talented muslims you clearly have no knowledge of our hire practice or talent pool have interview and hire many professionals over the past decade would be fine with lose whatever talent saw this as dealbreaker i'm sure if use the cramp room to do something could do at my cubicle i'd get funny look from the women pump their breast
i'll mention that to the other 90 of the muslims who work here who don't pray during lunch the point be use work resources for religious activities think would more readily object to christians do this edit to remove name call which at the time be satisfy
not just now--there's recession go on
thank for your input note you can go back to masturbatingrightnow
maybe they're as afraid of be label bigot as be and wouldn't mention it even if they be annoy
if you read the article many many people here be different from me honestly love that about where work love to learn about different culture and love to travel don't know anyone who work in more diverse environment than where work my point be about people use the common area for their private religious beliefs don't know that islam be much stupider than christianity or judaism but don't particularly care for them use common areas for their rituals they may have ask where they could worship during their interview--i'm not sure as haven't be ask this question myself i'm curious to ask their supervisors
i'm question the propriety of them use it for their religious rituals would prefer they keep their religious observations to their cubicles or outside of work double standard would be if expect them to be treat different from christians or jews don't
be bigot because i'm complain about muslims or would still be bigot if they be christians you may be grown-assed woman capable of stand up for yourself--but be all women if their privacy be invade you don't think their fear of be label bigot could keep them quiet
i'm bitch here--not at work if be woman who's breast-pumping be interrupt in the cot room because some guy want to come in and practice their religion i'd be bitch at work actually here i'm express some thoughts in expectation of interest commentary which might help give me context
agree about the women they should stick up for themselves don't agree about provide common area in the workplace for the practice of religion
ahh agree that treat women different from men be double standard however it's not one i've ever have to defend i've never have female staff member who be accuse of spend their work hours in the cot-room so if double standard exist it's not come from me someone else post that the rooom be most likely there as require by law for women to pump their breast this however have nothing to do with the muslims pray issue you seem to want to say i'm hat on the muslims be imagine that as i've say don't want anyone practice their religion in the common areas at work
think i'd be more likely to complain if they be christian because i'd be less worry about be label bigot have read article about common areas in great britain be take over by muslims as prayer room result in discord at work for myself just think religion should be keep at home
thank you--i do not know that won't go change all my post though
i've be to prayers at the mosque before with friends know why they pray but yes your response be why post here--i certainly don't want to be label the bigot don't like the office space be use for religious activities christian or jewish or muslim don't think it's appropriate but i'm not ready to complain about it maybe shouldn't based on most of the responses here it seem shouldn't wonder if this be post in atheism if i'd get different responses
apparently someone else be more knowledgable than me about the need for the cot room it's apparently require to be there because of the size of the company and be there for women who need to pump milk while lactate you're right--there be double standard--i should complain about god not allow me to lactate
let me ask you--as christian would you consider it your right to perform service at work
i'm guess if hadn't mistakenly reply to your comment you wouldn't now be say have edited my post above sorry someone else misunderstand my mention middle east and pakistan in close proximity to one another as mean one be within the other
and net of zero exactly as many upvotes as down be post for feedback on my initial gut instinct that the room probably shouldn't be use for religious purposes--and in retrospect i'd probably title it religious people use cot room at work for service or something like that i've satisfy myself that i'm basically against it for because of the religious aspect as oppose to the muslim aspect but the way write it it sure seem anti-muslim in any case the consensus seem to be that should ignore it--which may as well do it doesn't affect me thank for comment
you be correct hence the deletion just field bunch of you're be dick comment in short period of time--same time as your comment
no please that's why post it i'm always curious about the existence of my own prejudice that just see as common sense in this case buddhists be good point because christians mormons if you decide they're not mainstream christians scientologists and muslims would probably all bug me buddhists less so because well because of my own prejudices--i don't find them nearly as annoy or dogmatic in general though have meet some dogmatic buddhists--a weird japanese sect cult have to deal with in the past but on strictly non-religious term i'd have to object to them too it just probably wouldn't have pique my interest be it buddhists though would have wonder why they be use the cot room which be pretty much the private room for the females in the office

look young poor men have be use as cannon fodder for thousands of years by rich white prick soldiers be not wake up nor be you go to wake them up the solution doesn't rest on educate soldier the solution rest on build society where there be alternatives for the poor to sign up as mercenaries for fat white bureaucrats
well rich white people start the really big ones make you feel better
your point be make hammered even kind of run over and around the traditional u.s. history of use poor black men as cannon fodder but ok yes people of all color love to kill people my point remain it's not about wake soldier up it's more about education and class

in general agree with you appreciate your comment think if they mean anyone--buddhist christian hindu or muslim be set up prayer room complete with statues etc and pray out loud in manner others could hear think it would definitely be out of line there be grey area and what level be acceptable definitely depend on the circumstances the culture etc in the case at my work decide don't care--they're not hurt anyone
i've have this happen time to time when my lower back be all out of whack basically the spine pinch the nerve going to the chiropractor have always fix the issue

since your description of alcoholism describe many people at different part of their lives--people who may drink normally now or at other time in their past--i can't accept it as description of disease unless the disease come and go which most people who be in aa think it do not have be in aa for long time and while find it can be helpful don't think alcoholism be disease and don't think your description make it one keep come back
you have the easiest job in the world
you can't discuss symptoms and diagnosis of something that's not disease maybe you could call it condition the wide variety of symptoms people attribute to alcoholism could and do represent whole variety of other stuff the alcoholism one hear describe follow no set course have no set symptoms have no trigger mechanism other than drink apparently--and i'm sure you've meet many many who talk about how their alcoholims affect them even when they be not drink nothing that fit the usual definition of disease you can call it condition if you like--like depression whatever that doesn't make it disease have read the preface of the big book many many time probably hundreds of time that doesn't mean attribute anything scientific to anything dr silkworth say there he be try to help some mess up drunks but that doesn't mean his ideas be any more than psychobabble agree that alcoholims be define somewhere as disease the reason for that have more to do with pressure from the cult of aa who basically push the recovery industry go ask your gp if he think alcoholism be really disease in the end you miss my point--they don't talk about it in aa but there be many many people who act as you describe yet go on to live long live not be obsess with alcohol know quite few i'm not talk about myself i've be sober 14 years next week and still go to aa meet but that doesn't mean i'm blind to the fact that aa mischaracterizes alcoholism all the time
you start out talk about the definition of an alcoholic later you write the amount of alcohol you consume have little to do with diagnosis of alcoholism take the need to diagnose something as an implicit understand that there be something to be diagnose that and you use the word alcoholism stray from your start point where you be define alcoholic
no

shit have there be study on the immune system response to chimerism that's way cool since hear about chimerism i've wonder how it could affect so many different things you could probably murder someone leave dna and get off if they take sample for test from the wrong part of the body wonder if any murderers get off because of this probably pretty unlikely but someday it could come to be you mention above about the million dollar question--unaffected by the hormones of the other set of genes would your brain feel more man or more woman than it do now you may never know if the organ that do your think for you be xx or xy and agree it doesn't matter--just interest but would it work different if not tie in one package affect by those genes and hormones not to mention the artificially introduce hormones thank for do the iama totally think that chimerism be the strongest argument to any think person that sexuality be totally personal and god be he to exist and be reasonable couldn't have anything to say about who want to screw what now back to the sex questions--you've have sex with men it seems--when you fantasize be you more likely think about straight sex or something different or just be hold or what yeah know too personal thank again

nope google doesn't want to be national isp they want to create test bed where they can show that the open access model work and where they can test next-generation ads as well as collect data that's useful in debunk lot of the nonsense put forth by incumbent isps
ten years of write about telecom full time as career every single day that and the fact that google be clearly tell me we're not go to be an isp where do you get yours
that's dude
if it make you feel any better even with all this craziness i'd still bang her
yeah dude it's my fault for not travel to china in the 18 years ive be on earth and should be more sensitive to the fact that my math professor be nt understandable and should learn to understand his grammar i'm definately the problem
actually you say bullshit when tell you what be actually go on now you're assume i'm simply take google claim at face value while give me lessons in journalism for whatever reason that's odd and borderline asinine but whatever it's the internet google simply want test bed where they can collect data to use in the policy arena highlight how the open access model could work they'll deploy the core fiber to the home network then they plan to have other isps come in and compete on top of that network to actually serve support and bill the end user google get the add perk of test next-generation video-based service and ad delivery they get yet another bonus of an ocean of data on congestion and network usage data that the mega-isps traditionally never release the move's mostly about test future video ad technology while gather statistical ammunition for lobby and policy they be absolutely hated by carriers like at&amp and verizon it's unlikely they want to shell out the multiple dozens of billions for national hugely expensive ftth network being an isp be hard business because it's utterly dominate by few very powerful players and know google would rather that somebody else build that network
http://gigaom.com/2010/02/10/google-doesnt-want-to-be-an-isp-it-wants-to-be-a-rabble-rouser we be not plan to roll out nationwide isp network this be test bed for innovation
competitive isp be not high margin who the fuck say well it be if you're verizon and you've be pamper for generations by government have monopoly in many market and repeatedly get endless subsidies and tax break for do nothing building last mile national ftth home network be certainly not high margin in fact with the way that incumbent carriers like at&amp verizon and comcast have government under their thumb it might even be suicide mission

there be absolutely nothing law dmca provision or otherwise require that an isp disconnect users for copyright infringement meanwhile many isps will threaten user with account disconnection but haven't actually disconnect any users verizon be good example of this the whole process be rotten there's no objective verification of guilt and the punishment of internet disconnection far exceed the crime of download some tv episodes
yes and you also have the right to get sued when you incorrectly threaten someone's internet connection when they didn't do anything wrong http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-10444879-261.html
like that you see the entire picture that's refresh personally see huge problems with the fact there's no independent oversight of these disconnection threats http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-10444879-261.html
unfortunately many users only have the choice of one isp

here's my setup my buddy have 30 mb comcast connection in town connect router dd-wrt but that's not important to his cable modem this router be the heart of everything and provide dhcp for everything for simplicity on his roof have ubiquity bullet-m attach to 21 dbi grid antenna point at my house 5.5 miles away we have line of sight this bullet be set in base station mode and be set with an ssid just like any wifi base station at my house have another bullet-m attach to another grid antenna but this bullet be set into client mode and connect to the base station bullet this bullet be then plug into switch in my basement and that switch then feed the rest of my network the router back at my buddy's house be the default gateway for the entire network and from network layout the wifi bridge be just more address on flat network both bullets be poe so there be just one cat5e run to the roof there be no noticeable add latency as the speed of light over 5.5 miles be negligible the connection have be rock solid stay up even during blizzards and heavy rain it have only go down once in months and simply power cycle the client bullet fix it
see above no repeaters be need have direct line of sight
13 miles will be no problem as long as you can see your target get on the roof with telescope that's what do see above for detail about my setup
it be more like 200 for pair of bullets antennas and masts
nothing noticeable there be much more latency between my buddy and comcast than there be between the two of us
the bullet be just wifi basestation or client depend on how it's set up with poe port on one side and an antenna connector on the other
so they get system set up to try to collect money and anyone who doesn't want to pay can easily criticize it because by nature it's an arbitrary system so people who complain often just sound like whiny people because they look for any reason to complain because in the end they just don't want to pay yeah it's not bad system

i'd imagine you'd identify with it as far as tv movies go i'd say it's pretty good
have not doing that kind of stuff would require lot of autonomy or control over something subtle which be why it seem completely plausible that disney animators may have http://www.subliminal-messaging.com/disney-subliminal-messages
an above the line film/tv producer occasionally we'll work on project as an ep executive producer but for the most part be pretty much the lead producer on the project we've have success in feature and in television an ep title be actually sort of second position to the film's actual producer its give to investors or those involve who be involve in put it together but not actually involve in the day to day the line producer do the on set work put together budget and the team but the creative producer be the guy who find the material talent and studio and put it all together that's what we do
the first season be actually pretty realistic the writers of that show all work in the industry so they be just take what they know and put it on screen take ari gold for example he base completely on ari emanuel his personality be exactly how piven portray him it be bizarre see people work with do cameos of themselves on screen or when the crew would go to restaurants or bar that me and my friends go to the major difference be that things rarely work as smoothly for anyone as they do for vince and his guy but consider someone like that fairly accurate portrayal of someone initially leach off of someone success and parlay that into management career that in reality would eclipse the star success but then again its fiction and everything need to work out so they change lot of the minor detail that make hollywood such hard place to actually make it in
there be sort of complicate system of non-solicitation cannot tell you how many time day writer will cold call us or mail us their script and we always have to turn it down or send it back know you like your script but need proof that its worth my time to read we like many company in hollywood have non-solicitation policy it's both protection against liability and way to vet good script the way we accept script be from an agent or manager we work with that way if the script be terrible then we'll know not to trust that manager or agent's taste again now the question how do get an agent or manager they too usually have non-solicitation policies know its vicious cycle but they'll read your script if you or your script do something to get their attention you can submit your script to the nicholl fellowship http://www.oscars.org/awards/nicholl/index.html which be one of the few respectable screenwriting competitions you can also have someone inside the industry praise your work and send it to managers or agents they know or you could go the long shoot route and just send it until someone read it
for anonymity's sake i'm go to skip this one but if it mean anything our biggest film come out in the last five years and make more than 350 million you'd be surprise there's actually lot of surprisingly nice people in the industry but there be studio executive who be behind the lotr trilogy no connection to me who leave really good impression on me best day on the job be probably early on in my career when be ask to take look at pile of script that come in at the bottom of the pile be this weird thriller that actually really like so tell my boss who have me tell his boss and 24 hours later the script be setup at studio with directors all over town interest in make it here be this 100 or so page that suddenly become something tangible because saw the potential in it that power be pretty exhilarate and career affirm worst day would probably be back when be work at talent agency have just work 13 hour day and not feel well and come in the next day to be yell at for things well beyond my control as the day go on get sicker and sicker until eventually after work full day excuse myself against my boss protest and drive to the er and have emergency surgery that night yes i'd very much like to be in the hot seat pursue project that interest me but be producer especially in this economy and the way the industry be go it be all become crapshoot you can spend years even decade of your life try to get movie make and it may never happen
actually haven't have the opportunity to work with lot of big name actors i've briefly meet lot of them but its always pleasantries especially when they're just come in to meet with the boss but there be actors who be famously terrible to work with http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/jun/14/film.features
it's not hard to break in its just hard to move up yes i've work in the mailroom with mba's and people twice my age your experience and education mean zilch in this town what be your undergrad no what be your agency who be your boss these be the things that people care about pretty much anyone who try can get into the mailroom its how you control your career after that matter the most who you work for will dictate your path and the opportunities you'll have do want to do this as career but there be days weeks probably months where question whether it's worth it today it be
well it's certainly an interest life you lead why do you think it would make good hbo show would you see it as script series or reality show if it's script then the next step be to write down what you think make your life interest and what stories you could tell about it right an overall outline and then write out your pilot script if you think reality then you'd need to think of how'd you pitch it what do the average american want to see about your life what happen on regular basis that would make your life interest taking big love for example it be about polyamory but the real story be about relationships unlikely though they may be and feel of strike out on your own and be husband how would your story be different
the normal sort of order for the assistant route do be to work in the mailroom of agency and then work as floater to learn the basics then land job on young agents desk and eventually move to big agents desk from there you use your boss's clout or connections to get an assistant job at the studio or at production company do the grind work and eventually prove yourself able to find good material and sell it you do this until you can strike out on your own and do it for yourself if do decide to leave think i'd want to do something creative but as far from the industry as could get
you figure it out http://www.deadline.com/2010/06/exclusive-paramount-to-make-les-grossman-film-for-tom-cruise
could you be little more specific if you be ask that from cynical perspective mean that the entertainment industry doesn't produce anything and be therefor an industry build on fake products then i'd say you're right but then again what we be create be content as our obsession with technology grow it be the content that will be use to fill it personally love movies love be take away from my reality and take on an adventure if only for little while love that be part of the machine that make that and it doesn't matter who you be or what you produce films/tv be always go to be there either to destress you after work long day or to entertain you when you have nothing else to do if you're ask from very childlike perspective to work in an industry where we make imagination come to life i'd say it's very cool the amount of time and effort it take to turn the write imagination into something visual and real be mind-blowing you can't help but appreciate even the dumbest movies because no matter how terrible they be they're craft they're system of tool use to show you other worlds particularly be in awe of how fx house be able to create things that lurk in the darkest reach of our imaginations and respect the writers directors and actors who commit themselves to that idea in order to create these worlds and entertain you for few hours
the majority of my job be sit at desk make call respond to email and schedule meet at my busiest deal with about 300-400 email 200 call and schedule 20-30 meet day it sound stupid but each email each call each meet may lead to project so its necessary to pursue the rest of my time be spend look for new material so it mean read lot of script and try to see if any be good enough to attach ourselves to and sell when we're in production my job also have to take on the responsibility of make sure all the above run smoothly while we be physically on set and knee-deep in day-to-day problems of production anything more specific in mind
in reality lloyd would have already be an agent years ago he work for the head of the company do his time but for some reason he's sort of in this suspend place because the audience love him as the assistant so yes do what lloyd do but i've move on to the next step however if lloyd be real person he'd be do much better than me i'm still an assistant but yes ari lloyd and be probably the most accurate representation of entertainment people on that show
i'm not defend i'm curious what about the industry do you see as an outdated dinosaur and why do you think it won't adapt those amateurs be always go to be lure by the think of more production value and there's always go to be someone will to finance that production value as long as they have way of make their money back either through internet distribution dvd sales or other
do you think it will feel like cruise be just desperate to win back the hearts of people that he's will to run funny joke into the grind no
sadly it's still in development and probably will never see the light of day but blame that on my boss at the time feel like if it have be me would have be stronger about get it make but it teach me that its all possible just need to keep look for the next great thing but have also read early early versions of script and track their development and see the movies they rarely match up to the potential in the script example be stranger than fiction but sometimes they make it work 500 days of summer
there be two sort of people that producers develop ideas with there be those who be or have the life-rights to crazy/eccentric interest people the other people we meet with be writers who come in with creative original idea that they want to write or have write while think your life be interest don't think its specific or original enough for someone to option your life-rights but it sound like you be very passionate about this idea and think you should write it out think try to write it may prove to be good exercise in hone what be it that can have the audience relate to you now at the end of the day you may still say your write be terrible which it may be but then you'd have focus on how you want it to look once you have that that's when you should ask around to see who could help you write it cause as producer's that's what we want we want well write story about this crazy world and then we want to meet you and find out it's all very real
