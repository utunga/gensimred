one common misconception about christianity be that you will become perfect and no longer struggle with sin and this be completely unbiblical and find nowhere in the bible we as christians will always struggle and fight with sin and it be our job to make war against our sin and flesh prayer help and we do ask god to help us through our struggle and over time many struggle do get better while others we will continue to struggle with all our live this may sound discourage but the great thing about christ be that the same grace he have impute to us and save us from our past sin will continue to sustain us and save us from our future sin as well recommend read future grace by john piper

you can't judge it on the first few painful paragraph almost quit too but push on and think this be one of the best profile i've read this year in magazine by far it will certainly be the only one remember like last year's hillary clinton profile http://www.esquire.com/women/women-issue/hillary-clinton-0510

didn't mourn my dead baby son full term months old at death by dress him up in fuck clothe and parade him around let the funeral home take him and we have funeral now do have pity for the santorums over their loss of what they perceive as son yes do however don't have any sympathy for them politicize it if it be just for them think they'd shut the fuck up about it no think it be just another thing they want to force on others their perception that any fertilize egg be equal to person granted their view be that their baby die after birth i'll agree with that sorry about that but what they do be weird in the us that's weird
don't critize the family for their feel but in us culture take dead baby home and dress it up be weird say that as parent who lose month old baby now the fact that they do it and it be weird i'll let them have that agree everyone deal with grief differently but they be the ones politicize it they be the ones use this evidence that abortion be wrong it may have be wrong for them and you but don't parade your dead premature baby near me use it as evidence that should abort my fetus fuck them edit to take out reference to two days--the headline be misleading--article doesn't say this
ha
for the sake of clarification--he be seven month old baby mean he be bear and die seven months later different order of tragedy not deny their pain--just question their use of that pain for politics
you know read the article and gloss over that what he do still seem weird to me---but again it's his pain his child just resent his implication that someone else's fetus should be hold in the same regard as he hold his and thank for correct me don't appreciate sensationalized headline they should be abolish
yes read the article but apparently gloss over the actual time my mistake for trust the headline this do not change my point in any way though thank you for correct me on the timeline

themes like betrayal and redemption be kind of essential part of storytelling in general don't you think to say something be formulaic be to ascribe that the idea of the film be not original that it have use try and test formula to create content something like sport movie where there be an underdog team/person who have to overcome struggle to prove themselves be an example of formulaic movie think something like the ides of march be relatively unique in its set and story and relatively contemporary give the state of national politics now the idea of the naive newcomer's relationship with mentor la wall street may be tread on familiar grind but think it have at least in the trailer lot more go on formulaic be term that get use lot and its fine when something truly merit it but its really such cheap shoot to say when it doesn't

do consider their point now what would they like me to do

thanks do it myself use an image from morguefile.com which have tons of great image you can use free for such purpose it be really pretty easy to put together just crop the image bite and add text
id hasn't craft truly innovative game in decade or more depend on whether you like quake and their contributions to recent evolutions in engine technology be arguably over-rated base on early problems with this title and limitations on its license don't see what's to reward
also agree he's get downvoted by people with fond memories of play doom in their basement haven't really be interest in an id title since quake think unreal tournament be more innovative than quake 3...and everything since have be pretty droll imo far cry be more innovative than doom fallout3/borderlands more innovative than rage pattern repeat
yeah don't disagree doom and quake be cornerstones of my game youth and the company deserve great respect for that but there's give them lot of credit and then there's insist they're still tier top shelf developer when they haven't make truly creative and compel game since 1997 quake or 1999 quake

make the remark because think most people be not aware that manson didn't actual kill anybody myself find it interest when read up on him don't care about this semantic argument don't care about bachman don't even think the guy who think manson be serial killer be an idiot for not know manson didn't kill anyone--i think he's an idiot for support bachman and don't think you're an idiot but it's clear to me you didn't understand why make the comment to begin with

if you release it have it fuck ready seriously especially give that it's pretty clear that extend development time wasn't put into particularly innovative gameplay mean if your and your fanboys primary defense of the fact you don't innovate in the gameplay department be because you're so incredibly skilled at design engines have that technology work seem kind of important to me

prefer trail run but end up do the vast majority of my run on the road the biggest reason which kind of go hand-in-hand be the nearest trail be 1.5 miles away from my house to run on the trail have to do 1.5 miles on the road to get there plus 1.5 miles back or else drive if i'm go to run miles on the road anyway might as well just do the whole thing which usually isn't much longer than that anyway to drive would be 10 to 15 minute hassle could have half my run do in that amount of time otherwise have 2-year-old daughter my wife and get home around 5:30 p.m and we both have to get in our run the few minutes get now be hard to come by as my wife have to basically babysit while i'm go and there's tons of stuff to get do before we go to bed to add any amount of time to what already do just isn't possible for me right now all that say in the summer can usually get out to the trail by my house if head out early and love it

why so serious
what next any post criticise obama
know feel like it'd be interest to read it as things kind of fall apart as you go kind of like frankenstein's study or whatever but don't know if could get through all shelley's descriptions of the set etc again with them be even harder to read

i'm sorry to hear about your misfortunes and know 29 be young people like you have something to complain about those barely out of their teens less so have to put my time in work crappy job for years make hardly any money even to get to where be now are today's youth will to do the same
exactly remember what it be like for me at 19 would've jump right in with the movement when be that age too but also look back on the things do then and think boy be naive things be lot more complicate than many of today's youths be will to understand
but there be only canadians on reddit
agree with much of what you say though again i'd say it's more because of the way the world be advance in term of technology etc than it be the fault of this faceless wall street everyone's so mad about
you probably be in highly competitive position with 10 people who could replace you in moment would argue that describe most job which be my point companies don't have to pay someone lot if they don't want to because so many people be qualify to do things that not too long ago be more restrict to just few candidates if don't work cheap for instance the next guy will as access to education and technology expand and improve we'll see job disappear that's not wall street's fault
if you don't understand it go way beyond the simplicity of blame wall street would argue you're be naive even if wall street disappear tomorrow the problems people be argue about would still exist
it just worry me to see teenagers fight economic systems they can't understand completely at their young age how many 19 year-olds carry mortgage for instance how long could 19 year-old have be on unemployment it bother me when see occupy wall street protesters on the news and none of them look older than 20

once homeless man be get hit and push around by girls on main st call 911 and they get there and stop it within few minutes
good guy good cop ya that cover it
do you want to live in country where you can't go to the park because people have decide to camp there 24/7 that's just ridiculous you can be in public area you just can't live there
oh god you're not go to get shoot at if you seriously believe you're go to get shoot by the government for protest wall street you're delusional believe it or not the government doesn't see you as threat
you're right good point retract everything say because you think the government be scar of protesters
ugh
a. you can say whatever you want about the u.s. not be free but you won't find more freedom most place in the world b. cellphone cameras and the internet aren't the government cellphone cameras and the internet be the people they wouldn't be an issue if people didn't buy them and use them c. there be no rich and 99 protesters there's the rich the protesters and the 98 who think both side be ridiculous and out of touch with reality
no one care enough to shoot
but it sound like you're say the only people who can create job be the wealthy which isn't true at all
don't do talk point do critical think tend to avoid jump on bandwagons as rule identify with ows but i'm not go to be part of movement just because there's movement as far as the use of wall street as target be gross over generalization that's one of my major hangups with the ows movement they're fight gross generalization with no specific measurable goals at least that i've see
would say think for myself you can find experts on both side of any issue that doesn't excuse lack of think critically about the situation for yourself
all the graph tell me be should have be banker you could do similar graph with doctor or engineer both professions as rule will be more lucrative than that of an editor or car salesman or whatever and depend on where you live 35,000 to 40,000 will get you nice place to live food on the table and car with money leave over especially if you're marry and both people be work i'm still struggle to pay off college debt too but all this go to prove my point in general we're all upset we don't make enough money or have this or that etc but it's not that we can't have it it's just that we have to take the time to build it and many people aren't will to take the time they want to live like they make 100,000 now and that's just not realistic
would argue that the job of yesterday don't exist because the world be different place not just because rich people don't want to pay employees anymore why would you buy guitar at the local guitar shop for 300 for instance when you can get the same one for half price online from the warehouse with free ship and possibly no sales tax this be perhaps poor example but it go to show my point things like the internet have make access to goods and service much easier mean many job like those at guitar shop in this example be no longer go to be need or will be need less soon expect high school will disappear altogether along with high school teach job as access to education improve through the internet will that be wall street's fault
my parent didn't send me to school they couldn't afford it so send myself but i'm not out sit in park tweet on my iphone about how my cool friend just get arrest because they didn't step aside when police officer tell them to step aside can't afford an iphone
one month later...dies
he's not be shoot and he's very obviously resist arrest while this be an isolate incident of the many thousands of protesters this have happen to very few understand your point this video look bad and make me want to side with the protesters though to be fair don't know the whole situation
true can't argue with that
agree with most of your point would argue the constitutional right point isn't true but don't see how the current crop of protesters plan on change anything most be white and look younger than 25 the local movement here just look sad http://photos.mlive.com/4469/gallery/group_occupy_gr_still_going_on_monday_morning/index.html don't know about where you're at but around here those look for job don't match the description of the majority of those protest the apparently dominant profile demographic of the protesters be also notoriously fickle when it come to vote if everyone protest be register to vote and actually do so on election day perhaps some of these grievances could be remedied until the movement spread to the general populace i'm afraid the 99 be just another on the opposite end of the spectrum from those they oppose
hate every ape see from cimpan-aaa to chimpan-zee
the fact that would have to head on over to r/occupywallstreet and do some investigation in the first place show how little headway the protest be make with the general populace i'm make real effort to understand and still don't get it so how do ows expect the rest of the country to get behind them the color pink be immediately associate with the fight to end breast cancer in the same way the ows movement need to have an immediate measurable goal the spring to mind the minute you hear about them otherwise it's just bunch of kid shout in the park
police quest
make one of these http://imgur.com/a/enryl
don't think the financial system should stay as it be at all and i'm no expert just don't think wall street be to blame for everything and use them as blanket organization on which to cast all our problems be naive again wall street could disappear tomorrow and we'd have the same problems we have today don't know that have better solution but don't think what ows be do will be effective in the long run
but that's my point your dad's job can be do by more people now so they can pay people less to do it that's not wall street that's evolution in 20 years we probably won't have half the job we have today they'll all be automate or do by machine or won't be relevant anymore we have to create new job and new industries not blame exist employers because the job that exist today don't require small set of uniquely skilled laborers
disagree the media be more democratic today than ever before many of the top-trending stories on reddit alone the last couple weeks have be ows relate just because ows isn't break news on huff post every hour doesn't mean it's not cover all over the web people be ask for reason to stand with the protesters and they're not be give one people need simple complaint they can get behind if the movement be go to be effective
ugh don't remind me of 2008 vote for hope and change with the rest and all we get be weakness and concessions to the minority party now we have nothing the patriot act be good point but think peaceable assembly be be respect people be just do it wrong you can't peaceably assemble in place where it's illegal to go at certain time but you can peaceably assemble elsewhere the boston thing about group of 10 if true be violation but the other examples cell phone tap search before you get on plane don't consider violations you don't have constitutional right to use cell phone or to fly on plane those be private service you're opt into don't see how their sit in park bitch about things be any different than my sit in my home bitch about things and that's the problem they aren't idiots with nothing to say but they aren't say much coherently you can say what you want but people be look for way to get behind the movement but can't find one because there's no unify purpose outside of vague political rant about revolution and we be the 99 which they aren't they're just the on the opposite side of the they're oppose the rest of us 98 be just try to figure out what they're fight for

here's little legal mumbo jumbo so you have some reference by stay in the hotel and pay for it you enter into contract with the hotel technically if you pay for the two or days to stay there then you be legally in contract for those days by kick you out the hotel be in breech of the contract and legally responsible for their action additionally in most state the right of hotels to evict guests be the same guests may be evict from hotel when the guest engage in disorderly conduct there be non-payment of charge such as the price of the room room service etc the premise be use by the guest for an unlawful purpose or act bring dangerous property onto the premise gun bomb etc fail to register as guest use false pretenses to obtain accommodations violate local state or federal law while on the premise violate post hotel rule or fail to vacate room at the agree check out time from what it sound like the only thing they could possible think of evict you for be the last part however if there be no agree check out time between yourself and the hotel on that date that you be evict they have no legal stand one final thing if you be holdover guest mean that you do not make reservations for the room ahead of time and be just extend your stay the hotel be only in legal contract with you for the predetermine days of reservation technically if you stay an extra day the hotel have no legal obligation to you and will most likely choose to honor the contract with future guests with that be say hope this help and good luck

uhm fuck ignorant christians who decide to bring their own stupid beliefs into what we as christians actually follow if it's too deep for you to understand as christian then maybe you shouldn't blindly speak on the matter instead of look like hateful ignorant mother fucker people like you make christians look bad and incorrectly display who our god actually be go actually figure out who you be follow before you blindly speak
this be in response to the christian not the atheist
believe that from her beliefs she be prophetically speak whether she should post that on facebook idk it's normal to her however it may not be normal to you
if someone do would normally say that don't believe in that the exception be say grace because don't care enough to make stink will add to this that some quite reflection can be quite nice but rather then look for answer from god attempt to sit quietly and sort out my problems myself don't get angry at the mention be annoy when it begin to effect public policy and when people cite god or the bible source when they be make an point ex gay mirage do not know what create the universe what be or what phenomena all know be that we be try to find provable solution it seam like allot of religious people have problem say they don't know the answer to question as if that show weakness but see person look for real answer rather then just say its can't be explain therefor god ex the tide come in the tide come out
think of scientists as brutus
you think you be eat god nope chuck testa
use to have this theory in my transition phase god create the universe in days but how long be day to god could be extralmly long and the bible might just be version of events that humans 2000 years ago could understand so god create the earth and evolution happen this idea work until you relise that god doesn't need to be in that equation and it make more scene without him
you might want to look into the unite church they be more about the value and less about the literal unlike catholics

come here to say what you say thank you
this guy have great tip of jerk it especially the mirror thing need to try that some time but its ok because would think of my girlfriend
why not have both
his cheeseburger screen
didn't he ask you to disprove that he isn't god its seam you claim we be all god or part of him
you be on the internet place where people be very skeptical actually allot of religious folks of all creeds must be sub to atheist why not compare yourself to rival religion rather then just discussion board make up of religious and non religious people
human's like to pigin hole we know blink-182 and the ramones be diffident but we still call it punk
ya this be place where people tend to think differently would hate the idea of be coddle and tell everything be ok because god be watch over me want to live my life free and independently very interest but scary
sorry just typo there and we can prove he isn't god if he be say he be the god of the bible that would be an interest distinction
it's interest you say that hear that allot would agree on one condition and that would be if atheists believe there be no god that would be belief because there be no proof that no god exist but that's not the case atheists be just people who don't believe in things that aren't prove so there may be god there just isn't any proof of it and since lack of proof isn't proof to the contrary they be leave in state of limbo until proof be bring forward anyways what do your comment have to do with my post just think its bad comparison and you might be happy to know christians out way muslims on reddit by about factor of if your into that
that take me about read to get it
see it just seam bite off topic but that ok see your point but yes lot of atheists beloved there be no god and that's just silly thing because your can't prove it it would be nice if there be new word to represent them because they be not atheists like richard dawkins he belives there be no god if it wasn't in the morning would make new thread about this bite you know midterms

not reply never work this wasn't the first encounter i've have with him i've know him for like 5ish years if didn't reply he would just keep texting want it to stop

he hasn't message me since ask if those line actually work that be over week ago haha
use to work with him so he have my number for that
what mean by this be would see meme about something christian would blindly say against atheists and the counter remark of the atheist so give that the majority of what christians say especially over the internet for some reason be ignorant and hypocritical feel as if lot of atheists have distort view of not the religion but the actual relationship that be present it's constant struggle to speak about because i'm not try to take it as an approach of i'm better christian but it's the harsh truth that lot of people make christianity into religion and believe religion be corrupt
believe everything the christian religion entail without the religion view my status as follower of christ to be relationship between the creator and the creation believe that humans create religion and it just make cluster fuck of hypocrisies grow up in church and watch christians live one way in church and whole different live outside of it believe you should be the same both inside and out and you can accomplish that by live out the morals set by god personally believe this of course
about atheism in particular not in general sense i'm curious as to if there be different level of atheism and that kinda sound dumb but there be so many level of christianity it's dumb be personally non-demoninationl christian because don't believe my beliefs should be limit
religion and relationship be two separate things
in literal sense completely understand it's religion what be try to say don't believe for me personally it be religion myself because from my personal experience in church people corrupt the morals distort them and bend them while in the same time allow there to be certain level of how strong your relationship be with god by how you act in church
good question and be do very well thank you enjoying going quantum mix while eat pizza and expand my beliefs through talk to you gentlemen
personally take it one at time or as combination it's call the live word because it have the ability to speak to your certain situation so easily however at the same time that can make it very confuse to some if you take everything in literal sense still find myself be puzzle by some of the things in the book but that's what keep it all interest be figure it out for yourself
here be my problem with how some people perceive facts it's so easy in this day and age to hear fact time-and-time again and begin to believe it it take an actual effort to find out true fact for yourself
i'm not ask you to trust or believe anything do
there be no possible way can disprove those gods however do not believe any other god exist were they smart to worship them from intellectual view worship any god isn't logical respect their faith though believe my god be real because have seem him heal physical injuries in front of my eye there have never be time where couldn't worship him and not feel completely free and sober after do so the literal physical peace feel after talk to him be the reassurance in myself need
to be honest that be personal make up statistic there's no say you wouldn't fall under the same life-style as the mass but know that the true pure morals that be present in the bible lead to better physical and emotional life and this be obtain without the corruption of such things the problem be we people be imperfect and fuck up lot it's just how life work
you can keep your 10 friend lol do enjoy explore what others believe but just as you believe there be no god so strongly believe there be simple know
they be present in the bible clearly and sometimes hide for me to go through years of moral beliefs would be unrealistic is there anything in particular you want to know about what believe besides why i'm christian
going back to what say be mean to speak in religion as in what people have make it to be the literal and definitive mean of religion be clear should find another word for this but have yet to find it
going back to what say be mean to speak in religion as in what people have make it to be the literal and definitive mean of religion be clear should find another word for this but have yet to find it understand the actual definition can anyone here help me with word to describe what be refer to when speak about the corruption of what people have make religion out to be
would you mind educate me on what organize religion be thanks
i'm not tell you to live under anything i'm not tell any of you to believe what believe i'm try to learn what you believe
in my mind what we both believe doesn't make either of superior over the other sorry to word incorrectly
yep that's what atheists believe where do you want to go from there
like your point of view it's very hard to believe in something that seem illogical for me the combination of faith and the personal spiritual experience have encounter be the reason believe there be god thank you for share
because myself have experience god super natural and unexplainable maybe even crazy sound know
because mention want to hear your beliefs and be want to freely mention mine suppose sorry if it bother you
because can't discriminate someone because they don't believe what believe respect the fact that they take action to follow something
mean not to make something up to support anything be share my personal experience and in second write down percentage believe it's different every time because each christian experience something different in life be tell things differently and continue to spread what they believe and make up their own beliefs base on what they experience
read up
read up
oh see people try to convert others daily as christian believe we be to show others the love of our father but believe that go about it in way of hey do you know jesus be unproductive and almost backslide so many people still consistently shove their beliefs down others throats it's hard to even see what they actually believe say speak your beliefs and let others figure out theirs
look up
who the hell say be right and you be wrong lol
elaborate on why you think so if you will
be refer to picture of church people hold sign that say gays be go to hell that kind of negativity isn't need in this world
oh understand it's battle between what seem natural and what be above the natural lot of my beliefs come from faith but my faith come from experience god like say
be raise in christian home so it be easy to say what believe be solely because my parent spoon feed me the bible but have always be one to look at both side of the picture and even the stuff in between if there be anything have always enjoy hear other view point have experience god and even see physical injuries heal super natural things can't be explain do blindly have faith maybe in your eye which be fine by me that's extremely slippery slope and completely twist view of what be say experience god because open myself up and allow him in not because be above anyone else
mean not to untag myself as christian be follower of christ however like say above lot of traits that have be pick up by christians have label them as hypocrites and judgmental do not want those traits or those title place on me and do so by live through example do you consider yourself more agnostic or atheist
should have use this definition from the begin thank you
some do some don't buddy i'm not sit here just to simply share beliefs everyone have opinions and some stress them more than others got it
there's joke hear once kinda want to share with you man be stick on top of his house during flood when man in boat call out to him ask if he could rescue him the man on roof reply no i'm fine god will save me second group of men come with the red cross offer to rescue the man no i'll be okay god will save me he reply helicopter shortly come after and drop the rope to rescue the man he continue to wave off the helicopter say god will save me hours later the man drown from the flood and ask god why he didn't save him god reply what do you mean why didn't save you send you boat the red cross and helicopter say this to bring to light that prayer alone isn't always go to fix situation god work in the physical as well and use humans or object to aid us lot of time now should we not give any credit to the doctor of course not but take no action and just pray isn't always the best thing to do
didn't say that either you automatically take defensive approach versus try to learn or share when say nothing directly to you so it appear you yourself have preconceive view of me because be christian now whether you mean to or not this be what look like to me
no have just realize there be more to the relationship we share with our creator than church on sunday morning yawn all you want though i'm not try to entertain you lol am be completely comfortable with christianity the thing want to refuse be the preconceive view place on christians due to negative experience with christians
yes haha discover that term tonight
don't attempt to offend me by lower the name of my god by call him my imaginary friend please we both know that such term be non-productive
have be you call me motherfucker turn me off be no longer arouse to speak to you
honestly it's such sore subject to talk about because it's deal with love have no problems with homosexuals as people at all do not agree with their personal decisions because personally believe it's against human nature but mean hey if you love them then what can stop you as far as the preachers with bigoted sign disagree strongly with them
yes have and no internet link will tell me otherwise and your book be obviously polar opposite than mine and that's fine be not spread lie just as much as you aren't simple know
like your perspective thank you
idk how to underline and quote what you say in my reply but it's true you could train children to believe anything but put them in world that tell them that there be no god where everything they read hear and see be tell them there be no god and then to experience god on multiple occasion be different story have always evaluate what felt or saw and cross examine such events with people who be there with me at the time it's fun pick apart reality
i'm not afraid to question what believe that's how come to believe what do now by question it all like your perspective on the other religions experience god-like presence gives perspective
in my past experience could read page of it and gain nothing from it mentally but that one verse that pop out and speak to me about my direct situation and give me stability be how differentiate the ones need for that time or not believe need the whole book but just read it won't do anything have to discover something in the process
can respect that think could have just as much disbelief in the big bang as could with creator make everything to me they both have the same plausibility
my uncle have cerebral palsy his entire life one night at mass worship service hundreds of believers place hand on/around him as he report he felt burn sensation in his muscle we all watch him stand out of his wheel chair and run around with perfect muscle coordination be baffle another child be severely allergic to dairy products to the point where his throat would close up and have near death experience separate occasion people lay hand on him in agreement for his heal the next day he eat ice-cream for the first time in his life he continue to eat dairy products free of reactions to this day
because our faith be the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen because we can't physically see our creator
like you
exactly which be why separate myself from it read previous post
believe it would be hard for you to see any evidence because you don't believe in god so what would use as evidence you would counter as luck creativity or science which be perfectly okay it's just two different side brother
there's difference between learn about your beliefs and hold to what believe my friend

wow you must really love john travolta
which game be you professional in
hope you sing that out loud when you write it down
guess you could call that the god work in mysterious ways argument do you have counter argument have always find good way to write paper be to point out the flaw and then seal up the hole yourself
understand that there be no need but the problem be our society allow people to use this flaw logic to make decisions that effect all of us so until the rest of the world understand that the burden of proof lie with them we will need to argue this point
well that's my point because if he isn't someone to look up to then he isn't the god of the bible that why try very hard to keep god and god separate
what's the story
the slide scale idea to beliefs be interest will need to look into that more on another note i'm not very interest in richard because he do subscribe to the side that say's there be no god rather then say the biblical god be false and the existence of another god be unknown but maybe i'm just be fickle just note have not read his work just see his special on the bbc and watch few speeches
try not to think of it as team guess see people as be have position on this topic but don't think as people who have the same position as be on team do try to keep my mind open only change my opinion on god few months ago before think there be no god but then find myself unable to prove that there be no god just that the biblical one isn't there see what you be say about strengthen arguments but have find that if if attempt to strengthen an argument and fail then might just be wrong and move on change by think thanks for the definition ill give it look now
just read it over and think fit that general idea the only difference be that he say the problem be insoluble where be still want to find the answer maybe that's just young fool's dream
line by nature of god guess mean nature of the concept of god don't mean how god act mean how god be imagine line so point out old religions to show how silly they seam now like that but do see it as bite underhanded bite of lines4-6 to be honest think you could have keep your point much shorter it get little off topic but think can say that you be say shouldn't amuse anything about god however do not amuse anything about god just point out that god as he be describe in scripture be not possible god could exist in myriad of other ways so don't assume anything about god just show that the biblical assumptions don't add up about your last point just have problem when these metaphysical ideas we be argue about start effect my life so do find it importatint argue against shit people make up thanks so much for your input your effort and your time
