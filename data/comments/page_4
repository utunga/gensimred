my father is the inventor of the creamer the little cup of cream they give you with coffee or tea before the creamer restaurants would put cream out in little glass cups the first time he tried to sell the machines to beatrice they laughed at him and claimed that no one would want to pay the premium that the packaging would cost few years later after he had been selling the machines individually to restaurants they bought him out for approx 250,000 until the day he died my dad knew how much that industry made annually nobody believes me but we had one of the original machines in our basement when was young

you do realize that that quote in the book of revelations refers only to the book of revelations don't you the bible wasn't assembled as book until hundreds of years later
you do realize when that quote was written there were no christians right
so just by chance you got lucky to be born into the one true religion and you don't think your god must be dumb ass to let billions of other people live their lives without the truth you found
you still maintain fallacy that the investors themselves invest as if to create jobs they don't that's why lower tax rate for the corporations would never increase wages nor do investors create jobs people are greedy and don't give shit away investors invest only when they can make money for themselves government takes money from people and corporations because left to their own devices nobody would pay for the military or the roads or social security

this isn't too bad really
one common misconception about christianity is that you will become perfect and no longer struggle with sin and this is completely unbiblical and found nowhere in the bible we as christians will always struggle and fight with sin and it is our job to make war against our sin and flesh prayer helps and we do ask god to help us through our struggles and over time many struggles do get better while others we will continue to struggle with all our lives this may sound discouraging but the great thing about christ is that the same grace he has imputed to us and saved us from our past sins will continue to sustain us and save us from our future sins as well recommend reading future grace by john piper

think sometimes community moderators unfortunately
if the person goes and makes up some karma whoring headline and link to their blog it could be completely false but they can get thousands of clicks off of reddit if it gets upvotes which many do just from headlines that's exactly my point though this is what advance's websites do all the time so for advance to own something like reddit where this is frowned upon seems antithetical

the man suit is the probably the best book i've read in the past few years didn't like scary no scary as much but it's decent read too
while disagree with your premise should note that the poem as it appears in his book the man suit looks perhaps more like traditional poem and you may like the book highly recommend it
if you read just one read the first one stitches
fair enough if you're interested here are few links to some of his poems with more traditional line breaks the i'm not carlos poem as printed in his book looks more like the third poem listed here http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/winter03/zsislands.htm http://howapoemhappens.blogspot.com/2010/07/zachary-schomburg-was-born-in-1977.html http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmmid/21895
i've been running barefoot for just over two months now and i'm up to three to five miles at time three to four days per week the rest of the days run in normal running shoes and still often take day off between barefoot days prefer running barefoot whole lot more than running in shoes though and my goal is to get to the point where i'm doing it every day able to do longer mileage barefoot i.e as many miles as want right now five is the farthest i've gone bare and able to run as fast barefoot as do in shoes may be as fast now don't know i've never timed myself and feel like i'm going lot slower though that may be just because i'm paying so much more attention to my surroundings another plus an annoying knee pain had for long time is all but gone when run barefoot which is awesome
roads in my subdivision most of which are pretty pitted my feet look worse than they are but they're not that bad i'm not hurting or anything the big thing is try to go faster than i'm ready to and it messes up my form so when my feet do get tender think that's why plus like said the roads here live in michigan are terrible even the ones that look smooth feel jagged half the time what are you running on

yeah the manhole cover quote stands out as particularly egregious
almost gave up about third of the way through but kept going and thought it was fair by the end
do you read esquire on regular basis
you can't judge it on the first few painful paragraphs almost quit too but pushed on and think this is one of the best profiles i've read this year in magazine by far it will certainly be the only one remember like last year's hillary clinton profile http://www.esquire.com/women/women-issue/hillary-clinton-0510

didn't mourn my dead baby son full term months old at death by dressing him up in fucking clothes and parading him around let the funeral home take him and we had funeral now do have pity for the santorums over their loss of what they perceive as son yes do however don't have any sympathy for them politicizing it if it was just for them think they'd shut the fuck up about it no think it is just another thing they want to force on others their perception that any fertilized egg is equal to person granted their view is that their baby died after birth i'll agree with that sorry about that but what they did was weird in the us that's weird
don't critize the family for their feelings but in us culture taking dead baby home and dressing it up is weird say that as parent who lost month old baby now the fact that they did it and it was weird i'll let them have that agree everyone deals with grief differently but they are the ones politicizing it they are the ones using this evidence that abortion is wrong it may have been wrong for them and you but don't parade your dead premature baby near me using it as evidence that should abort my fetus fuck them edited to take out reference to two days--the headline is misleading--article doesn't say this
ha
for the sake of clarification--he was seven month old baby meaning he was born and died seven months later different order of tragedy not denying their pain--just questioning their use of that pain for politics
you know read the article and glossed over that what he did still seems weird to me---but again it's his pain his child just resent his implication that someone else's fetus should be held in the same regard as he held his and thanks for correcting me don't appreciate sensationalized headlines they should be abolished
yes read the article but apparently glossed over the actual time my mistake for trusting the headline this does not change my point in any way though thank you for correcting me on the timeline

ok so what other movies have have used this formula what other movies are about young idealistic campaign pr person debating the ethics of undermining his candidate for personal gain
reddred you are 100 correct on this you made an incredibly clear and straightforward argument throwm34way will keep fighting but it's obvious he's defending very particular self-satisfying view and will not change freeloaders should just be thankful reddit doesn't need the ad revenue enough to block content to those with adblock on cause god-forbid an internet visionary like throwm34way might have to look at 300 x250 image advertisement while looking at his funny cat pictures
themes like betrayal and redemption are kind of essential parts of storytelling in general don't you think to say something is formulaic is to ascribe that the idea of the film is not original that it has used tried and tested formula to create content something like sports movie where there is an underdog team/person who has to overcome struggles to prove themselves is an example of formulaic movie think something like the ides of march is relatively unique in its setting and story and relatively contemporary given the state of national politics now the idea of the naive newcomer's relationship with mentor la wall street may be treading on familiar ground but think it has at least in the trailer lot more going on formulaic is term that gets used lot and its fine when something truly merits it but its really such cheap shot to say when it doesn't
you don't like the trailer that's fine but i'm incredulous because you keep misusing the term formulaic boring sure that's your opinion formulaic is very tangible thing and i'm telling you this isn't formulaic and as for betrayal/redemption being an essential part of storytelling defy you to tell me one famous story where there isn't betrayal and redemption
object thing person or matter to which thought or action is directed an object of medical investigation this is an object that could not possbily kill person
haha interesting choice farewell to arms is definitely not an obvious pick for betrayal/redemption because it's war that is controlling their actions they suffer at it's whims but redemption is definitely there i'd make the argument that their relationship is initially based on falsehood lie they both tell each other then over the course of the story they both develop sincere feelings enough to change who they are henry leaves the army for her for the relationship as is hemmingway's style he subverts the expectation and our protagonist is not rewarded for his redemptive act in fact he's punished for it

for what purpose public awareness to accomplish what i'm aware they're upset what do they want me to do about it
feel like it's taking turn toward the ridiculous as well because they aren't outlining what they want no one knows what's going on cnn even has post up titled what does occupy wall street want and from what read they can't even answer the question
do consider their point now what would they like me to do
if this is true they need to make it better known and not end their sentence with etc they need to be specific listing not just what they want to see i.e serious campaign finance reform increased regulation of pacs end of the revolving-door policy but specific steps that need to be taken to see those things happen

honestly haven't been impressed by an id game since quake this looks beautiful but uninspired
very interesting things to think about
ahhh different though isn't it can't believe people are picking at this thing was hitler war criminal he wasn't serial killer
lol you posted this like baws
behold the unfathomable power of the mods wiggles fingers
there been systematic campaign by the political class to whip up hatred against the banks so don believe it was an honest mistake
thanks did it myself using an image from morguefile.com which has tons of great images you can use free for such purposes it was really pretty easy to put together just cropped the image bit and added text
id hasn't crafted truly innovative game in decade or more depending on whether you liked quake and their contributions to recent evolutions in engine technology are arguably over-rated based on early problems with this title and limitations on its licensing don't see what's to reward
also agree he's getting downvoted by people with fond memories of playing doom in their basement haven't really been interested in an id title since quake thought unreal tournament was more innovative than quake 3...and everything since has been pretty droll imo far cry was more innovative than doom fallout3/borderlands more innovative than rage pattern repeats
yeah don't disagree doom and quake were cornerstones of my gaming youth and the company deserves great respect for that but there's giving them lot of credit and then there's insisting they're still tier top shelf developer when they haven't made truly creative and compelling game since 1997 quake or 1999 quake

made the remark because think most people are not aware that manson didn't actual kill anybody myself found it interesting when read up on him don't care about this semantic argument don't care about bachman don't even think the guy who thought manson was serial killer is an idiot for not knowing manson didn't kill anyone--i think he's an idiot for supporting bachman and don't think you're an idiot but it's clear to me you didn't understand why made the comment to begin with
was talking more about the hordes of folks that still seem to defend the id brand almost pre-ordered on steam last night due to some of the hype so hear you think i'll wait for sale since october is pretty heavy with other games....and i've got serious backlog still

if you release it have it fucking ready seriously especially given that it's pretty clear that extended development time wasn't put into particularly innovative gameplay mean if your and your fanboys primary defense of the fact you don't innovate in the gameplay department is because you're so incredibly skilled at designing engines having that technology work seems kind of important to me

prefer trail running but end up doing the vast majority of my runs on the road the biggest reasons which kind of go hand-in-hand are the nearest trail is 1.5 miles away from my house to run on the trail have to do 1.5 miles on the road to get there plus 1.5 miles back or else drive if i'm going to run miles on the road anyway might as well just do the whole thing which usually isn't much longer than that anyway to drive would be 10 to 15 minute hassle could have half my run done in that amount of time otherwise have 2-year-old daughter my wife and get home around 5:30 p.m and we both have to get in our runs the few minutes get now are hard to come by as my wife has to basically babysit while i'm gone and there's tons of stuff to get done before we go to bed to add any amount of time to what already do just isn't possible for me right now all that said in the summer can usually get out to the trail by my house if head out early and love it

you know might regret later writing this--but it seems to me worrying about her being sexually abused is you worrying over nothing as society think we have definite concerns about children being sexually used because it fucks them up well your daughter already has bunch of problems that likely won't get worse because some guy is having sex with her without her full understanding maybe she'll be lucky and enjoy sex she may run into guy who beats her but it's probably more likely she'll run into string of guys who have sex with her and leave her is that so bad for her probably not as bad as for someone in different situation thanks for writing that something rarely if ever said lost son many many years ago if he'd lived he'd have been in wheelchair operated by mouth device his whole life i'm grateful was able to spend time with him but know it's better for me he passed it doesn't mean didn't love him just as i'm sure you have deep love for your child good luck with her

know feel like it'd be interesting to read it as things kind of fall apart as you go kind of like frankenstein's studies or whatever but don't know if could get through all shelley's descriptions of the setting etc again with them being even harder to read

i'm sorry to hear about your misfortunes and know 29 is young people like you have something to complain about those barely out of their teens less so had to put my time in working crappy jobs for years making hardly any money even to get to where am now are today's youth willing to do the same
exactly remember what it was like for me at 19 would've jumped right in with the movement when was that age too but also look back on the things did then and think boy was naive things are lot more complicated than many of today's youths are willing to understand
but there are only canadians on reddit
agree with much of what you say though again i'd say it's more because of the way the world is advancing in terms of technology etc than it is the fault of this faceless wall street everyone's so mad about
you probably are in highly competitive position with 10 people who could replace you in moment would argue that describes most jobs which is my point companies don't have to pay someone lot if they don't want to because so many people are qualified to do things that not too long ago were more restricted to just few candidates if don't work cheap for instance the next guy will as access to education and technology expands and improves we'll see jobs disappear that's not wall street's fault
if you don't understand it goes way beyond the simplicity of blaming wall street would argue you're being naive even if wall street disappeared tomorrow the problems people are arguing about would still exist
it just worries me to see teenagers fighting economic systems they can't understand completely at their young age how many 19 year-olds carry mortgage for instance how long could 19 year-old have been on unemployment it bothers me when see occupy wall street protesters on the news and none of them look older than 20

once homeless man was getting hit and pushed around by girls on main st called 911 and they got there and stopped it within few minutes
good guy good cop ya that covers it
do you want to live in country where you can't go to the park because people have decided to camp there 24/7 that's just ridiculous you can be in public area you just can't live there
oh god you're not going to get shot at if you seriously believe you're going to get shot by the government for protesting wall street you're delusional believe it or not the government doesn't see you as threat
you're right good point retract everything said because you think the government is scared of protesters
ugh
a. you can say whatever you want about the u.s. not being free but you won't find more freedom most places in the world b. cellphone cameras and the internet aren't the government cellphone cameras and the internet are the people they wouldn't be an issue if people didn't buy them and use them c. there is no rich and 99 protesters there's the rich the protesters and the 98 who think both sides are ridiculous and out of touch with reality
no one cares enough to shoot
but it sounds like you're saying the only people who can create jobs are the wealthy which isn't true at all
don't do talking points do critical thinking tend to avoid jumping on bandwagons as rule identify with ows but i'm not going to be part of movement just because there's movement as far as the use of wall street as target being gross over generalization that's one of my major hangups with the ows movement they're fighting gross generalization with no specific measurable goals at least that i've seen
would say think for myself you can find experts on both sides of any issue that doesn't excuse lack of thinking critically about the situation for yourself
all the graph tells me is should have been banker you could do similar graph with doctors or engineers both professions as rule will be more lucrative than that of an editor or car salesman or whatever and depending on where you live 35,000 to 40,000 will get you nice place to live food on the table and car with money left over especially if you're married and both people are working i'm still struggling to pay off college debt too but all this goes to prove my point in general we're all upset we don't make enough money or have this or that etc but it's not that we can't have it it's just that we have to take the time to build it and many people aren't willing to take the time they want to live like they make 100,000 now and that's just not realistic
would argue that the jobs of yesterday don't exist because the world is different place not just because rich people don't want to pay employees anymore why would you buy guitar at the local guitar shop for 300 for instance when you can get the same one for half price online from the warehouse with free shipping and possibly no sales tax this is perhaps poor example but it goes to show my point things like the internet have made access to goods and services much easier meaning many jobs like those at guitar shops in this example are no longer going to be needed or will be needed less soon expect high school will disappear altogether along with high school teaching jobs as access to education improves through the internet will that be wall street's fault
my parents didn't send me to school they couldn't afford it so sent myself but i'm not out sitting in park tweeting on my iphone about how my cool friend just got arrested because they didn't step aside when police officer told them to step aside can't afford an iphone
one month later...dies
he's not being shot and he's very obviously resisting arrest while this is an isolated incident of the many thousands of protesters this has happened to very few understand your point this video looks bad and makes me want to side with the protesters though to be fair don't know the whole situation
true can't argue with that
agree with most of your points would argue the constitutional rights point isn't true but don't see how the current crop of protesters plan on changing anything most are white and look younger than 25 the local movement here just looks sad http://photos.mlive.com/4469/gallery/group_occupy_gr_still_going_on_monday_morning/index.html don't know about where you're at but around here those looking for jobs don't match the description of the majority of those protesting the apparently dominant profile demographic of the protesters is also notoriously fickle when it comes to voting if everyone protesting were registered to vote and actually did so on election day perhaps some of these grievances could be remedied until the movement spreads to the general populace i'm afraid the 99 is just another on the opposite end of the spectrum from those they oppose
hate every ape see from cimpan-aaa to chimpan-zee
the fact that would have to head on over to r/occupywallstreet and do some investigation in the first place shows how little headway the protests are making with the general populace i'm making real effort to understand and still don't get it so how does ows expect the rest of the country to get behind them the color pink is immediately associated with the fight to end breast cancer in the same way the ows movement needs to have an immediate measurable goal the springs to mind the minute you hear about them otherwise it's just bunch of kids shouting in the park
police quest
made one of these http://imgur.com/a/enryl
don't think the financial system should stay as it is at all and i'm no expert just don't think wall street is to blame for everything and using them as blanket organization on which to cast all our problems is naive again wall street could disappear tomorrow and we'd have the same problems we have today don't know that have better solution but don't think what ows is doing will be effective in the long run
but that's my point your dad's job can be done by more people now so they can pay people less to do it that's not wall street that's evolution in 20 years we probably won't have half the jobs we have today they'll all be automated or done by machines or won't be relevant anymore we have to create new jobs and new industries not blame existing employers because the jobs that exist today don't require small set of uniquely skilled laborers
disagree the media is more democratic today than ever before many of the top-trending stories on reddit alone the last couple weeks have been ows related just because ows isn't breaking news on huff post every hour doesn't mean it's not covered all over the web people are asking for reason to stand with the protesters and they're not being given one people need simple complaint they can get behind if the movement is going to be effective
ugh don't remind me of 2008 voted for hope and change with the rest and all we got was weakness and concessions to the minority party now we have nothing the patriot act is good point but think peaceable assembly is being respected people are just doing it wrong you can't peaceably assemble in places where it's illegal to go at certain times but you can peaceably assemble elsewhere the boston thing about groups of 10 if true is violation but the other examples cell phone tapping searches before you get on plane don't consider violations you don't have constitutional right to use cell phone or to fly on plane those are private services you're opting into don't see how their sitting in park bitching about things is any different than my sitting in my home bitching about things and that's the problem they aren't idiots with nothing to say but they aren't saying much coherently you can say what you want but people are looking for way to get behind the movement but can't find one because there's no unified purpose outside of vague political rants about revolution and we are the 99 which they aren't they're just the on the opposite side of the they're opposing the rest of us 98 are just trying to figure out what they're fighting for

oddly enough believe that the contractors are not at fault people tend to forget to maintain their water lines until there is problem it would be nice if the contractors came up to the homeowner before starting work and told them the potential for breakage in the line and gave them chance to have it inspected and replaced ahead of time potentially saving them money on emergency repairs

here's little legal mumbo jumbo so you have some reference by staying in the hotel and paying for it you entered into contract with the hotel technically if you paid for the two or days to stay there then you are legally in contract for those days by kicking you out the hotel is in breech of the contract and legally responsible for their actions additionally in most states the rights of hotels to evict guests are the same guests may be evicted from hotel when the guest engages in disorderly conduct there is non-payment of charges such as the price of the room room service etc the premises are used by the guest for an unlawful purpose or act bringing dangerous property onto the premises guns bombs etc failing to register as guest using false pretenses to obtain accommodations violating local state or federal law while on the premises violating posted hotel rule or failing to vacate room at the agreed check out time from what it sounds like the only thing they could possible think of evicting you for is the last part however if there was no agreed check out time between yourself and the hotel on that date that you were evicted they have no legal standing one final thing if you were holdover guest meaning that you did not make reservations for the room ahead of time and are just extending your stay the hotel is only in legal contract with you for the predetermined days of reservation technically if you stay an extra day the hotel has no legal obligation to you and will most likely chose to honor the contract with future guests with that being said hope this helped and good luck

uhm fuck ignorant christians who decide to bring their own stupid beliefs into what we as christians actually follow if it's too deep for you to understand as christian then maybe you shouldn't blindly speak on the matter instead of looking like hateful ignorant mother fucker people like you make christians look bad and incorrectly display who our god actually is go actually figure out who you are following before you blindly speak
this is in response to the christian not the atheist
believe that from her beliefs she is prophetically speaking whether she should post that on facebook idk it's normal to her however it may not be normal to you
if someone does would normally say that don't believe in that the exception is saying grace because don't care enough to make stink will add to this that some quite reflection can be quite nice but rather then looking for answers from god attempt to sit quietly and sort out my problems myself don't get angry at the mention am annoyed when it begins to effect public policy and when people cite god or the bible source when they are making an point ex gay mirage do not know what created the universe what being or what phenomena all know is that we are trying to find provable solution it seams like allot of religious people have problem saying they don't know the answer to question as if that shows weakness but see person looking for real answer rather then just saying its can't be explained therefor god ex the tides come in the tides come out
think of scientists as brutus
you thought you were eating god nope chuck testa
used to have this theory in my transition phase god creates the universe in days but how long is day to god could be extralmly long and the bible might just be version of events that humans 2000 years ago could understand so god creates the earth and evolution happens this idea works until you relise that god doesn't need to be in that equation and it makes more scene without him
you might want to look into the united church they are more about the values and less about the literal unlike catholics
think they are trolling us hard just sent this to check want to attend your meeting tomorrow but i'm worried your not serious people seam to think that your poster's are ironic can you let me know so can make decision
that's talent make strong key hits when you do talk but don't get yourself be interrupted when you do just be polite
have special hell just for you one where you sit in chair and someone throws ten pound pumpkins at your head 24/7 gd little bastards
thats funny
actually let me clarify...a pumpkin was thrown at my car thus resulting in the windshield being damaged this also happened on day that had job interview noticed had no other car no ride no interview so yeah i'm little chapped
that's all you can say http://www.youtube.com/watch 3zowglt9cy8
they went to every newspaper stand on campus and took every phone book in the lobby mtv called nathan the other day and wants to use it on their show

vacuuming we have habit of using brand names for inventions ballpoint pens are called biros as result
fffffuuuuu
napping in college works well too
it stinks it makes the walls get all yellow and crusty it's easier to learn in school when your not under the influence first hand experience shouldn't kids be in class don't have problem treating weed like booze or cigarettes but i'm not ok with giving it free pass
the part when get to compete against my gf
newest favorite instrument
they can go skip class and go outside where and the other ton of people don't need to smell it just hate the smell allot like god bless but gosh btw that was such pleasant reply you deserve an up vote in fact up votes for all
so you are saying ban booze and cigarettes but legalize pot think that's silly argument because we shouldn't be governing what people can and can't do to themselves in the first place because if we can the other for safety reasons then we should ban weed too
and roller costers

how fast is the internet
wish this worked
ya its kinda hard didn't have reddit so transitioned over crazy long time so it didn't hurt or bother me
came here to say what you said thank you
this guy has great tips of jerking it especially the mirror thing need to try that some time but its ok because would think of my girlfriend
why not have both
his cheeseburger screen
didn't he ask you to disprove that he isn't god its seams you claimed we are all god or part of him
you are on the internet place where people are very skeptical actually allot of religious folks of all creeds must be subed to atheist why not compare yourself to rival religion rather then just discussion board made up of religious and non religious people
human's like to pigin hole we know blink-182 and the ramones are diffident but we still call it punk
ya this is place where people tend to think differently would hate the idea of being coddled and told everything is ok because god is watching over me want to live my life free and independently very interesting but scary
sorry just typo there and we can prove he isn't god if he were saying he is the god of the bible that would be an interesting distinction
it's interesting you say that hear that allot would agree on one condition and that would be if atheists believed there was no god that would be belief because there is no proof that no god exists but that's not the case atheists are just people who don't believe in things that aren't proven so there may be god there just isn't any proof of it and since lack of proof isn't proof to the contrary they are left in state of limbo until proof is brought forward anyways what did your comment have to do with my post just think its bad comparison and you might be happy to know christians out way muslims on reddit by about factor of if your into that
that took me about reads to get it
see it just seamed bit off topic but that ok see your point but yes lot of atheists beloved there is no god and that's just silly thing because your can't prove it it would be nice if there was new word to represent them because they are not atheists like richard dawkins he belives there is no god if it wasn't in the morning would make new thread about this bit you know midterms
biggest groner joke of the night
love that phrase i'd up vote you twice as well if could good sir

first off we using programs that would generate code for us we used program called hot potatoes to build sites and understand the structure of websites then we moved on to wysiwyg's mainly front page then went on my own learning to write more complex html in text pad js was part of that got hired to write in flash for while then learned php and html still try to keep leaning new stuff all the time but don't have much time because im in computer science

just want to point its also not the governments job to protect your kids i'm still young but kids are few years off after travel any advice from seasoned parent in the digital age
like to be an idealist but agree here we can't help some people
that's why when some people say there is no god that is belief because we have no proof there isnt generic god we can say the biblical god is wrong because we would stop suffering think atheists should tread lighter to avoid this fallacy
pausum lay motionless and she should move on
true should rephrase it's not the governments job to censor your children is that more agreeable

would like to show support and yet do not know what to say
what kind of lies did you find latter thought got most of them at once i'd like to know if there is more
think this was rude and for no reason he said he is and he is not that both are related now agree that people are easily blinded by god but this seamed to be just someone playing the hitler card if he said we are going to iraq to bring god would be right there with you but he didn't
caps lock cruise control for cool
can actually see her skin getting lighter in that video
looks like black got backed into corner
if they want to use that metaphor you can just point out that life if language the gets tested and when it fails it goes away so no one knows about the failures now think if you could write very hard test but wait you can't look at the questions you can only fill in bubbles at random now lets say you could retake the test x10 112392188974589734589 times do you think you would get 100 at least once well that one time is life as we know it

the ymca in madison has pretty good selection of free weights and barbells you might check the one in south huntsville to see if it does as well
interesting fact i'm hypothyroid and it basically prevented me from gaining weight also contributing to my lack of gaining weight is my ridiculous metabolism but still the hypothyroidism did in fact keep me from gaining weight probably because my thyroid is dead weigh like 100 lbs and i'm 5'4 so i'm kinda tiny funny stuff
saw that show read that book book was awesome show was pretty damn good from what remember
ha thanks i'll repost
haha thank you
well dead girls can't say no
live in madison and would second third vote for madison it's mostly families with kids of varying ages the schools are great the area is nice and suburban with low crime lot of parks and rec opportunities the only downside of madison is that as much as the town tries to claim otherwise it's bedroom community for people who work in huntsville there's not much in madison in regards to things to do it's mostly banks churches and doctors offices everyone goes to huntsville to do anything if you are dead set on living in huntsville city limits your best bet is south huntsville jones valley and the area around grissom are nicer but would be hesitant to be in the huntsville city schools with all the problems they have
let's see i'm 20 year old female i'm chef love every kind of music love zombies my favorite animals are hippos also love portal and tf2

playing hard reset at the moment and when you hit checkpoint save you know the shit is gonna fly
yes but as see it there are positions to the statement there is god true false null so the thing is that saying there is no god is leap of faith because we can't be sure there is no god that just chills out up there so choose to say we don't know but we shouldn't act as if it is true

not replying never worked this wasn't the first encounter i've had with him i've known him for like 5ish years if didn't reply he would just keep texting wanted it to stop
i've been told that many times friends that know me and the guy were shocked that actually shut him up
best weapon ever is the hard reset smart gun damn thing can shoot through walls

he hasn't messaged me since asked if those lines actually work that was over week ago haha
used to work with him so he had my number for that
what mean by this is would see meme about something christian would blindly say against atheists and the counter remarks of the atheist so given that the majority of what christians say especially over the internet for some reason are ignorant and hypocritical feel as if lot of atheists have distorted view of not the religion but the actual relationship that is present it's constant struggle to speak about because i'm not trying to take it as an approach of i'm better christian but it's the harsh truth that lot of people make christianity into religion and believe religion is corrupt
believe everything the christian religion entails without the religion view my status as follower of christ to be relationship between the creator and the creation believe that humans created religion and it just made cluster fuck of hypocrisies grew up in church and watched christians live one way in church and whole different live outside of it believe you should be the same both inside and out and you can accomplish that by living out the morals set by god personally believe this of course
about atheism in particular not in general sense i'm curious as to if there are different levels of atheism and that kinda sounds dumb but there are so many levels of christianity it's dumb am personally non-demoninationl christian because don't believe my beliefs should be limited
religion and relationship are two separate things
in literal sense completely understand it's religion what am trying to say don't believe for me personally it is religion myself because from my personal experiences in church people corrupt the morals distort them and bend them while in the same time allowing there to be certain levels of how strong your relationship is with god by how you act in church
good question and am doing very well thank you enjoying going quantum mixes while eating pizza and expanding my beliefs through talking to you gentlemen
personally take it one at time or as combination it's called the living word because it has the ability to speak to your certain situation so easily however at the same time that can make it very confusing to some if you take everything in literal sense still find myself being puzzled by some of the things in the book but that's what keeps it all interesting is figuring it out for yourself
here is my problem with how some people perceive facts it's so easy in this day and age to hear fact time-and-time again and begin to believe it it takes an actual effort to find out true fact for yourself
i'm not asking you to trust or believe anything do
there is no possible way can disprove those gods however do not believe any other god exists were they smart to worship them from intellectual view worshiping any god isn't logical respect their faith though believe my god is real because have seem him heal physical injuries in front of my eyes there has never been time where couldn't worship him and not feel completely free and sober after doing so the literal physical peace feel after talking to him is the reassurance in myself need
to be honest that was personal made up statistic there's no saying you wouldn't fall under the same life-style as the mass but know that the true pure morals that are presented in the bible lead to better physical and emotional life and this is obtained without the corruption of such things the problem is we people are imperfect and fuck up lot it's just how life works
you can keep your 10 friend lol do enjoy exploring what others believe but just as you believe there is no god so strongly believe there is simple know
they are presented in the bible clearly and sometimes hidden for me to go through years of moral beliefs would be unrealistic is there anything in particular you want to know about what believe besides why i'm christian
going back to what said am meaning to speak in religion as in what people have made it to be the literal and definitive meaning of religion is clear should find another word for this but have yet to find it
going back to what said am meaning to speak in religion as in what people have made it to be the literal and definitive meaning of religion is clear should find another word for this but have yet to find it understand the actual definition can anyone here help me with word to describe what am referring to when speak about the corruption of what people have made religion out to be
would you mind educating me on what organized religion is thanks
i'm not telling you to live under anything i'm not telling any of you to believe what believe i'm trying to learn what you believe
in my mind what we both believe doesn't make either of superior over the other sorry to word incorrectly
yep that's what atheists believe where do you want to go from there
like your point of view it's very hard to believe in something that seems illogical for me the combination of faith and the personal spiritual experiences have encountered is the reason believe there is god thank you for sharing
because myself have experienced god super natural and unexplainable maybe even crazy sounding know
because mentioned want to hear your beliefs and was wanting to freely mention mine suppose sorry if it bothered you
because can't discriminate someone because they don't believe what believe respect the fact that they took actions to follow something
meant not to make something up to support anything was sharing my personal experiences and in seconds wrote down percentage believe it's different every time because each christian experiences something different in life are told things differently and continue to spread what they believe and make up their own beliefs based on what they experience
read up
read up
oh see people trying to convert others daily as christian believe we are to show others the love of our father but believe that going about it in way of hey do you know jesus is unproductive and almost backsliding so many people still consistently shove their beliefs down others throats it's hard to even see what they actually believe say speak your beliefs and let others figure out theirs
look up
who the hell said was right and you were wrong lol
elaborate on why you think so if you will
was referring to picture of church people holding signs that say gays are going to hell that kind of negativity isn't needed in this world
oh understand it's battle between what seems natural and what is above the natural lot of my beliefs come from faith but my faith comes from experiencing god like said
was raised in christian home so it is easy to say what believe is solely because my parents spoon fed me the bible but have always been one to look at both sides of the picture and even the stuff in between if there is anything have always enjoyed hearing other view points have experienced god and even seen physical injuries healed super natural things can't be explained do blindly have faith maybe in your eyes which is fine by me that's extremely slippery slope and completely twisted view of what was saying experienced god because opened myself up and allowed him in not because am above anyone else
mean not to untag myself as christian am follower of christ however like said above lot of traits that has been picked up by christians have labeled them as hypocrites and judgmental do not want those traits or those titles placed on me and do so by living through example do you consider yourself more agnostic or atheist
should have used this definition from the beginning thank you
some do some don't buddy i'm not sitting here just to simply share beliefs everyone has opinions and some stress them more than others got it
there's joke heard once kinda want to share with you man was stuck on top of his house during flood when man in boat called out to him asking if he could rescue him the man on roof replied no i'm fine god will save me second group of men came with the red cross offering to rescue the man no i'll be okay god will save me he replied helicopter shortly came after and dropped the rope to rescue the man he continued to wave off the helicopter saying god will save me hours later the man drowned from the flood and asked god why he didn't save him god replied what do you mean why didn't save you sent you boat the red cross and helicopter said this to bring to light that prayer alone isn't always going to fix situation god works in the physical as well and uses humans or objects to aid us lot of times now should we not give any credit to the doctors of course not but taking no action and just praying isn't always the best thing to do
didn't say that either you automatically took defensive approach versus trying to learn or share when said nothing directly to you so it appears you yourself had preconceived view of me because am christian now whether you meant to or not this is what looked like to me
no have just realized there is more to the relationship we share with our creator than church on sunday morning yawn all you want though i'm not trying to entertain you lol am am completely comfortable with christianity the thing want to refuse is the preconceived views placed on christians due to negative experience with christians
yes haha discovered that term tonight
don't attempt to offend me by lowering the name of my god by calling him my imaginary friend please we both know that such term is non-productive
have been you calling me motherfucker turns me off am no longer aroused to speak to you
honestly it's such sore subject to talk about because it's dealing with love have no problems with homosexuals as people at all do not agree with their personal decisions because personally believe it's against human nature but mean hey if you love them then what can stop you as far as the preachers with bigoted signs disagree strongly with them
yes have and no internet link will tell me otherwise and your book is obviously polar opposite than mine and that's fine am not spreading lies just as much as you aren't simple know
like your perspective thank you
idk how to underline and quote what you say in my reply but it's true you could train children to believe anything but put them in world that tells them that there is no god where everything they read hear and see is telling them there is no god and then to experience god on multiple occasions is different story have always evaluated what felt or saw and cross examined such events with people who were there with me at the time it's fun picking apart reality
i'm not afraid to question what believe that's how came to believe what do now by questioning it all like your perspective on the other religions experiencing god-like presence gives perspective
in my past experiences could read pages of it and gain nothing from it mentally but that one verse that pops out and speaks to me about my direct situation and gives me stability is how differentiate the ones need for that time or not believe need the whole book but just reading it won't do anything have to discover something in the process
can respect that think could have just as much disbelief in the big bang as could with creator making everything to me they both have the same plausibility
my uncle had cerebral palsy his entire life one night at mass worship service hundreds of believers placed hands on/around him as he reported he felt burning sensation in his muscles we all watched him stand out of his wheel chair and run around with perfect muscle coordination was baffled another child was severely allergic to dairy products to the points where his throat would close up and have near death experiences separate occasion people laid hands on him in agreement for his healing the next day he ate ice-cream for the first time in his life he continues to eat dairy products free of reactions to this day
because our faith is the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen because we can't physically see our creator
like you
exactly which is why separate myself from it read previous posts
believe it would be hard for you to see any evidence because you don't believe in god so what would use as evidence you would counter as luck creativity or science which is perfectly okay it's just two different sides brother
there's difference between learning about your beliefs and holding to what believe my friend

true but there are specific times where person has come to me who did not know and spoke to me about something that related completely to my situation at the time or where someone would give me certain amount of money that they heard god told them to give as love offering and it was the exact amount needed to pay something off this has happened on numerous occasions and to my knowledge there are two plausible answers they either had complete luck in randomly talking to me and providing for my extremely specific need or what they were saying was true and they heard from higher power the information
this too me an embarrassing amount of time to figure out get it because she didn't tell anyone about her daughter get it

wow you must really love john travolta
which games are you professional in
hope you sung that out loud when you wrote it down
guess you could call that the god works in mysterious ways argument do you have counter argument have always found good way to write papers is to point out the flaw and then seal up the hole yourself
understand that there is no need but the problem is our society allows people to use this flawed logic to make decisions that effect all of us so until the rest of the world understands that the burden of proof lies with them we will need to argue this point
well that's my point because if he isn't someone to look up to then he isn't the god of the bible that why tried very hard to keep god and god separate
what's the story
the sliding scale idea to beliefs is interesting will need to look into that more on another note i'm not very interested in richard because he does subscribe to the side that say's there is no god rather then saying the biblical god is false and the existence of another god is unknown but maybe i'm just being fickle just note have not read his work just seen his special on the bbc and watched few speeches
try not to think of it as teams guess see people as being having position on this topic but don't think as people who have the same position as being on team do try to keep my mind open only changed my opinion on god few months ago before thought there was no god but then found myself unable to prove that there is no god just that the biblical one isn't there see what you are saying about strengthening arguments but have found that if if attempt to strengthen an argument and fail then might just be wrong and move on change by thinking thanks for the definition ill give it look now
just read it over and think fit that general idea the only difference is that he said the problem was insoluble where is still want to find the answer maybe that's just young fool's dream
line by nature of god guess meant nature of the concept of god don't mean how god acts mean how god is imagined line so point out old religions to show how silly they seam now like that but do see it as bit underhanded bit of lines4-6 to be honest think you could have kept your point much shorter it got little off topic but think can say that you were saying shouldn't amuse anything about god however do not amuse anything about god just point out that god as he is described in scripture is not possible god could exist in myriad of other ways so don't assume anything about god just show that the biblical assumptions don't add up about your last point just have problem when these metaphysical ideas we are arguing about start effecting my life so do find it importatint argue against shit people make up thanks so much for your input your effort and your time
