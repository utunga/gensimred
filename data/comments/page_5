yes they should have go with live nation from the begin
you'll want more or less everything temporary backpacker have only better quality good sturdy waterproof tent and solid backpack would also suggest decent shoe but never backpack in anything but sandals xd garbage bag be must they have so many use and you can throw one over your bag when it rain depending on where you're head pack appropriate clothe last year be on the road for over months and start with little more than clothe tent headlamp toiletries and notebook pick up stuff that realize need as move pack your cash/plastic/passport in super secure place and guard it with your life there be great pack that hang around your neck and you can hide under your shirt never take mine off except for when bath so not all that often lol also pack photocopy of all your important document espeically passport in case anything should happen to the originals
45 be little small for hitchhike you'll need to fit few meals worth of food couple pair of clothe decent tent sleep bag sleep mat etc aim for something in the 60 range anything sell at mountain equipment co-op be great quality check these http://www.mec.ca/ast/shopmec/packs/weekendalpinepacks.jsp where be you plan on hitchhike i'd recommend train hop only as last resort if you're strand you can get in fair bite of trouble for that these days

do it mcgill be top notch school in an amaze city have to get there in 30 mins so can't write anything else xd
think you may want something little bigger that look more like an overnight pack i'd aim for something in the 60 ranger although you could get by with something smaller if you're really regiment with your pack look at the 60 pack on the mountain equipment co-op website they're really good value and crazy rugged do months in europe last summer with about 55 and it be perfect just enough space for tent clothe food sleep bag mat etc
how old be you when you say you be model for superdry belgium do you mean catalogue model if so would have think they be all the same accross europe for which team be you play now what be the thing you believe you be miss to be happy
lol this be my video
well it depend if you're never go to be camp you'd probably be able to manage as you wouldn't have to lug around tent/mat/sleeping bag and pillow but it's your call and now that look at the description it say 4350 cubic inch be the capicty which be 70 if that's true then this pack look very mislead and be probably in fact too big xd
that's impressive but if you be roadtripping you have the extra space of the car could manage hitch with 45 but with my tent sleep stuff and micro-stove find 60 be ideal
now here game can play fuck your skyrim

my opinion not even close end up have an extend period of time during my train where due to medical reason be unable to fly decide to invest little bite of money in buy x-plane and set of yoke pedal and throttle to fly on my computer at home even only have spend 10 hours in real airplane could tell that my experience in home simulator be nothing really like fly some of the issue notice control sensitivity be my biggest issue the control where overly sensitive when they shouldn't have be at low speed where in real airplane it would take lot of input in the game would flip the airplane over likewise at higher speed where only little input would be need to make the plane behave in the game take more than it should have it didn't seem to vary base on speed you don't have the range of input that you do in real airplane take land for instance if i'm over the runway but unsure about my altitude above it as student this be really easy to do you don't have feel for it just yet can quickly glance out the window and see exactly how far above my wheel be in the game though all you have be what be on screen most sim game don't do good job of simulate things like wind try to set up crosswind takeoff scenario once and ace it because the wind be constant sure that happen sometimes in the real world but at least here it's usually crosswind that gusts from 5-10 kt my instructor would bitch about them he say he could always tell the students who play flight sim game because they be the ones super focus on the instrument instead of look out the windscreen so yeah imho do yourself favor and save that money for real actual fly you're gonna need it

gt what be the cheapest way to fly are some routes/dates cheaper coming from the us corsair be cheap option use kayak.com and maybe look into set up price alert it's usually cheapest to fly on tuesdays and wednesdays check nearby cities as well sometimes short drive to another airport will save you considerable amount gt how much extra money will need for the 2-3 weeks i'm in france not too much france may be wee bite more expensive here and there but if you stick to budget options the price isn't much more than in north america eating out of supermarkets be good policy gt are frenchmen and parisians really as arrogant about americans and non-french speakers should take french class if already speak spanish will be able to get by as long as you're considerate to their culture and well-mannered you should not experience any hostilities it's your duty to shape their impression of americans so do your fellow american tourists favour as for the language take french class be good idea regardless of where you're travel it's always fun to get new language under your belt that be say even if you study intensively between now and july you will probably only be able to get rudimentary understand of the language nothing wrong with that it will certainly help in this day and age though everywhere in western europe especially paris you'll have no trouble find people who speak some english if you go to paris with no knowledge of french and only spanish you will recognize plenty of word and you will probably be able to get an idea of what most write things mean and convey basic ideas orally but you won't be able to understand individuals who speak only french anyway that's my cents worth enjoy your trip
definitely get eurail pass for the price it's amazingly good value especially for students and with the global flexi pass you can do whatever you want whenever you want like move so usually spend 2/3 days in city and then hit the road but that's not for everyone to really get to know city you'll need more than days so it's up to you whether you want to relax more or move more couchsurfing yes it's simply the best thing ever europe be surprisingly small you can get from one country to the next in couple hours so don't dream small eastern europe be heap cheaper than western europe and also little more wild bulgaria be one of my favourite countries to this day little secret of mine there be cruise agency that operate out of venice's port call minoan lines if you can find them they'll take you to greece for euros if you show them your eurail pass true story

all from this one site they do have some good deal
beware of the confirmation bias
that's great point reservations can be hassle and add extra expense to the trip however even though they're highly encourage it's actually optional my friend and eventually stop make reservations when we realize this we would occasionally find ourselves sit by the cabin doors when all the seat have be fill but they would always just check our ticket and wish us happy trip nonetheless even in germany we walk on completely book tgv train with no reservation and with flash of our pass we be off albeit on the floor of the cabin so for really long trip definitely reserve unless you want sore bum but for short ones if you don't mind sit on your pack you'll save time and money thanks for remind me about the reservations ubermind
aw really that's such shame but good to know when go they be pretty relax about the whole eurail thing really half the time they wouldn't even stamp off days and we'd get few extra ones
this be all so good to know haven't even hear of airasia until now and their price look great check out your blog funny stuff but really doubt their service could be bad enough to bother me my usual method of locomotion have be hitchhike so far so comfort be the last thing on my mind haha
yeah the more read the more realize this
yeah get about 2100 by do it piece-wise most of the flight be finnair actually unfortunately they don't fly to montreal but they have killer price between asia and toronto
that sound amazing you're go to have the time of your life mate
that's the spirit pretty much sum up how feel before every trip there's always doubt and worry float around your head until you take off and there's no turn back but you just gotta shut all those out and run with it everything always work out and there's something you get from travel that you can't get anywhere else in life

by zilch mean no change for the better there be supplements/practices that i've try that have produce change for the worse for example gingko biloba make me feel cloudy and out of it and after exercise tend to feel bite mentally fatigue not the clear center feel that seemingly everyone else report for the record have continue with exercise run 3-4 miles every day or two and do the perfect pushup regime and the after effect of have become noticeably less severe can definitely imagine what would like to feel like the biggest change i'm seek be an increase in mental clarity at this stage it come and go throughout the day base on variety of factor but up until around puberty and subsequent major depressive episode experience full lucidity just about all the time this go hand-in-hand with more in-the-moment and emotionally intense existence don't wish to be child again but you better believe that desire to live this way again gt think you will find it worthwhile keep log and really try to notice the differences between substances and how they effect you i'm definitely interest in track my progress do you have any suggestions for track methods/programs i'm the kind of person that'll spend the rest of the day look for the perfect program and then still not be satisfy with find i'm hop to find something that have the ability to visually graph the various components of my mental performance over time ease of input and potentially something compatible with an iphone right off the bat i've consider use excel and especially if can find pre-made template i'll probably just go this route gt if you want more suggestions you should state health currently what you be take diet exercise what if anything make you happy excite etc what be it you be try to achieve of all the things you try what be the biggest successes what be the biggest failures how why i'm guess this might be better suit for brand new post but very briefly live fairly healthy lifestyle eat well exercise and currently don't take anything except for centrum vitamin and since its cold season emergen-c about once day and occasionally garlic pill to fight cold or the onset of one btw fom one random dude on the internet to another thank

you're go to have an amaze time i've freecamped all over australia and new zealand and it's wonderful way to save some cash would recommend pick cheap tent at aussie disposals when you get there when you're finish do the altruistic thing and drop it off at salvation army they have cheap one for 35 so it's no big loss if you're will to spend little more you can get something lot more compact/lightweight and if you pack conservatively the tent won't be any extra trouble even if weren't freecamping i'd keep tent on me just because you never know when you might find yourself without place to sleep as far as gear go all you really need be compact sleep bag you could also get an inflatable pillow and foam mat but if you want to save space you can just improvise these with your clothe tiny compact stave be also an option but those add fair bite of weight that be say after weeks of cold food one of those can be wonderful thing anyway hope some of this help
having take an exchange to the university of melbourne can say that this would fit almost all your criteria gt want to be close to nature and the beach surfing be not priority but would be cool good national park nearby would be awesome yup st kilda beach be short tram ride away from the city center and be wonderful spot to soak up the sun unfortunately it's in bay and doesn't have very big surf wave but lot of people surf there anyway gt like nice weather hot unless you're there between may to september the weather will be beautiful nice and hot and you'll avoid the ridiculous and painfully scald heat of the north brisbane and up gt like good public transportation and would like city where do not have to drive car melbourne's hop-on/hop-off tram service be excellent and pair with an expansive bus and train network there be really not much more you could ask for gt would like to live in city or place with vibrant culture/nightlife and be able to meet other students/people my age relatively easy do not want to feel isolate cannot stress enough how much melbourne would meet these expectations gt would like city/town that have nice accessible surround area that would lend itself to weekend and day trip there be also lot of great spot for day trip nearby the great ocean road be right next door as well as kangaroo island french island etc there be also cheap flight all over oz check tiger airways and jetstar melbourne be the only city with direct flight and boat to tasmania in addition to all this melbourne have an outstanding music scene unrivaled culture an extremely lay back atmosphere that nowhere else in oz seem to rival the people be friendly and welcome and uni of melbourne be in the top 30 school worldwide with beautiful campus hope this help regardless of where you decide to go you'll have fabulous time
they be never problem for me you'll definitely need sleep bag regardless of whether or not you camp and really lightweight person tent can be as light as 1kg although something that light will be bite more expensive so it's hardly hassle the tent buy in oz for 35 be little cumbersome and heavy but didn't really mind really good one i've be use lately be this one http://www.bronzemoonoutdoors.com.au/online-shop/msr-hubba-v5-tent it's quite expensive but boy will it last and it's only 3lbs and it handle strong wind like nobody's business as for stoves you can get ones for under 50 but the quality will suffer use this one http://www.mec.ca/ast/shopmec/memberpicks/hikingcamping/prd 4017-310 primus-himalaya-omnifuel-stove.jsp but it's totally your call neither of the ones i've show you be ones your go to want to ditch as they be excellent quality it's ultimately gonna come down to whether or not you want something little more expensive that will last you while or something cheap that you can toss when you leave oz seeing as you're go for over year something more expensive and durable might be worth the extra and you'll be able to bring it back with you when you're finish hopefully
hey awesome advice thanks so much think i'll definitely give all of those rout of inquiry serious look i'm familiar-ish with mindfulness meditation but the sedona method and nlp be new to me quick wiki search and scan through make nlp sound little iffy though but i'll continue read on do you have any personal or otherwise experience with any of these approach i'd love to hear about some first-hand account very motivate
the footprint isn't really necessary as the bottom of the tent be waterproof durable and quite easily repair you could even make one out of some tarp for fraction of the price for the tent one thing i'll suggest be get the people version actually have the people version of the one send you just grab the link before the extra space be certainly luxury but it's so great to be able to spread out your stuff and not be super cramp plus if you ever end up travel with friend you'll be set here's an exact model of the one have http://www.backpackinglight.com.au/prod313.htm i've use it in heap of countries and it's do amazingly plus it's only 1.8 kg while the person one be 1.4 kg so say the extra space for that tiny weight difference be worth it as for the stave it's definitely not necessary in fact if i'm plan on do lot of hiking/tramping in trip don't bother with it and it be bite of hassle to set it up but that be say it be nice to have when be in oz and nz didn't bring it along mainly because be use cheaper heavier tent and didn't have much extra space you also have to bring cook pot with you and hate do dish lol but on shorter hitchhike trip usually bring it regarding the weight don't be too intimidate if you have good backpack that distribute weight on your hips properly you'll be amaze at how much you can comfortably carry my girlfriend be about your weight 22 yo and she manage fine with full 60 bag it might be tough for the first little bite but you get strong fast

resume should be send in the format that the job post request it in at previous job where assist in the hire process this be back in 2004 or so we have very specific requirements in the job post as to how the applicant be suppose to send us resume plain ascii text in the body of the email contact information at the top with no cover letter and no attachments this be clearly specify in at least three place in every job post we make the reason be that if an applicant could not follow simple clearly spell out instructions that mean that they do not accurately read the job description and probably would not be good employee would you believe more than 50 of people who would apply for position could not follow those directions of those most just attach doc file some would do both paste the content into the email and attach file it be quick way to narrow down the applicant pool the ones who follow directions be the ones that get closer look now if the job post doesn't specify what to send it in send it in the absolutely most os-agnostic format you can pdfs be good tl dr follow directions and send what the post ask for if they do and bring nicely format one to the interview if they don't pdfs be fine

1st of all...never say be atheist 2nd yeah believe what you will but the belief that an almighty diety would choose to help an egotist like tebow be offensive and ignorant not to mention that it go against everything jesus teach everytime he take knee and thank his lord and saviour he be flaunt what he think be his moral superiority worship whoever however you want but keep it where it belong
she work at chicken express
think have to agree
and yet you care enough to leave comment
ok...here it be for all of you that cant read the rest of the post...not an atheist do believe very much in god do not believe that he interfere with daily lives...if he do assure you he would not choose football as the medium of proof

sorry...not flame anyone or troll by post this think the nfl community would at least share laugh at this at the very least agree with the frustration of lot of people that tebow and tebowing be painful at best enjoy watch good game and last sunday's game be one of the best but to see him take knee and pray ruin the point of the game it was/is about team work and to see him do this everytime undermine the other players that be my point and honestly think the nfl community would see that
its not just the pray in public every interview he do he first thank his lord and saviour and then if there be time he may work in the conversation the effort of his teammates as to the fact of his interventions well that be better leave in different thread
you be right but do become national craze the 1st time they do it tebow be seriously over rat he have no pass game personally the rest of the team deserve more credit than he do the man have market himself into oblivion and dont agree with the way he do it
actually in denver at the start of the season he be in every third commercial during game not so much since he's be play gatorade have field day with him or least the station out here do
if he can do it again then the argument be invalid right now he win lose most of which be because of bad throw and stupid turnovers and they almost blow 20 point lead on sunday the defense wasnt play good either at that time as to the children's hospital thats in the phillipines and that be commendable it be very much need in that country

don't think the game time have be decide just yet accord to the site i'm on phone so couldn't do ton of exploration buy ticket use terminal locate in 7-11 few days before the game think you can get it in english if remember correctly almost years ago now otherwise i'm not too sure how to go about it against yakult early in the season bet you can get ticket day or two ahead maybe even day of in the 3rd or 1st baseline bleachers at least public transportation be easy it's single line from umeda station if i'm not mistake take it to and fro with no difficulty get some fuusen balloon as you walk into the stadium and join in the fun of the 7th inning stretch

yeah unfortunately when you move from out-of-state the only place you can get license be at the main dmv office and there's only one for the whole county so you're kinda screw there my wife move here from tennessee and have to go there but her wait be only about hours fortunately you only have to do that once though once you've get an al license and tag you can go to the satellite offices or better the courthouse for renewals as for where to live it kind of depend on what kind of person you be if you have family usually recommend madison as it's mostly families and kid if you're single five points but imho pick the place closest to your place of work areas usually recommend people move here avoid old madison pike between the space center and 255 research park blvd and bridge street areas immediately north of uah roughly bound by sparkman jordan university most of holmes ave but especially between jordan and downtown pretty much all of north huntsville though hear some of the areas closer to downtown be get nicer areas off bob wallace between triana and memorial parkway
super mario bros hahaha just kid
dont think we need this poll to figure that out
unfortunately huntsville's downtown kinda suck it's mostly bank and law offices all of which clear out at 5pm so there's not lot of life in the even and weekend having say that things be improve and be lot better than when move here in 2005 there be few bar downtown amendment xxi come to mind sammy t's be there if you like music too as it crossroads and few decent restaurants sam and greg's and pane vino both have some of the best pizza in town and james steakhouse be amaze but so be the bill they're also start to redevelop part of downtown belk hudson lofts be currently under construction http://www.belkhudsonlofts.com and they're suppose to be re-developing councill courts http://huntsvilledevelopment.blogspot.com/2011/07/councill-court-whats-ahead.html so things be head in the right direction but be not really there yet

you must have never have wed my wife and have what consider to be pretty low-key wed but the cost still add up fast first there's the wed tax when you mention the word wed the cost of nearly everything go up about 30 then the marriage license invitations and stationary mailing djs facility rental for the reception catering alcohol and corkage fee cakes cake cut fee flowers photographer expenses for the bridesmaids and groomsmen tux rental transportation hotel the list go on like crazy we do every possible thing we could to trim cost we keep the guest list to reasonable number get marry in church no cost though it's traditional to tip the priest her wed dress be under 500 we print our own invitations and program on wed stationary we buy at target we handle our own mail and encourage people to rsvp online and thus didn't include return postage we provide our own alcohol for the reception and our own cater at the church guess what the cost of our low key wed be still nearly 10 and that doesn't include the nearly 5k drop on the honeymoon each one of these things in and of themselves be relatively cheap but they add up hardcore my budget no shit be like page in small type in excel and again our wed be low key compare to every other one we've be to have no doubt that at least one wed go to the person probably drop 50 on hell just have service do our invitations rather than us do them would have be an additional 2k when have wed it be very very easy to cross 15
