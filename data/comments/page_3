all that report do be agree with what say exxon doesn't pay income tax in the us that article be also write after ask an exxonmobil spokesperson who would never come out and admit their loopholes
if they raise cost too much that would screw them over as that would be the perfect opportunity for competitors to take their business
look at redli0nswift's comment http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/g55vg/iama_member_of_congress_rep_john_garamendi_back/c1kzpur
what i'm say be that exxon doesn't pay the us the full amount of income/federal tax that they should your article say that exxon pay sales tax i'm not specifically call out exxon i'm try to say that there be tax loopholes in the us and it's cost us money
you'd be surprise people easily get sway by the talk point that this be just about be fair

sorry it have take me so long to reply have be extremely busy lately and still be so this reply wont be very long be just go to try and give you little bite more to help you understand where be come from in your first argument about all other human emotions that god create yes he do create all human emotions my question to you be why would he not have create morality as well if he make all of the other emotions it wouldn't be logical to not create morality along with all of these emotions and your point be could these things combine to create morality well if all of these emotions be create by god and put together through human action wouldn't that mean that god ultimately create morality think so also regard your argument about morality and dna relate not to be rude but you sound like complete moron try to compare things that don't relate whatsoever adam and eve also have dna just because they be not bear doesn't mean that they didn't necesarily have dna you have not make an argument yet regarding your comment why an athiest or thiest should believe me that be not my job to do my job as christian be to share the gospel with those around me and what believe cant make you accept what believe only god can so it be not my job as christian to make you believe this but only merely to spread the gospel the bible make this perfectly clear just because adam and eve at from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil doesnt mean that do not understand not to eat from it you be make no point or argument again you dont have to eat from tree to understand the morality and law that god have lay in front of adam and eve he tell them not to eat from it so they be not suppose to eat of it this be the only knowledge they need to obey god they understand what they be do my question to you be if they didnt know what they be do why do satan tempt them if they didnt know not to eat from it they would have eventually eat from it without any need of his temptation this be an argument regarding the fact that even though be christian still sin you be clearly misinform and misunderstand christianity no where in the bible do it say that will never sin again just because be christian the bible do make it clear that will have new desire for god and righteousness which do and new hatred of sin which do the bible actually say that will suffer as christian even more so than none believer why do you think jesus say fox and bird of the air have home but the son of man have nowhere to stay he promise his followers that they would struggle and suffer in sin and temptation but this be not their final home heaven be the completion of christs work on the cross to finally bring his followers into new body where they will no longer sin so yes someone could ultimately as you say slip up and cheat on their wife as christian but their life will be mark by repentance and produce good fruit overall if they continue in this sin then it be merely evidence that they be never save and they never repent to follow christ saying god be an hole also want you to see...you be not make an argument you be simply make fool of yourself by spout off to understand calvinism and the will of god be go to give you link to great christian resource website of preacher name john piper he can say it much clearer than ever could this be an article on the two will of god and how he could appoint hitler yet still convict him for what he do and use it for good this regard more of salvation and election but this also work for how god could appoint hitler and still convict him of his sin it work in both case also be give you link to the proper doctrinal name for what believe answer these question about christianity and the bible and that be compatibilism be not try to sway you to believe in compatibilism but merely show you what mean and believe http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/articles/are-there-two-wills-in-god http://barrywallace.wordpress.com/2008/11/11/da-carson-and-ch-spurgeon-on-compatibilism yeah actually think it should impress you because can bet that you haven't memorize anything that substantial in content or length and also to inform you do understand it that be why choose to memorize that particular book have also make plenty of arguments that just because you dont believe them doesnt mean its not an argument regarding your last sentence how you think it be all crazy what believe...i will say you be right it do sound crazy but have faith hebrews 11:1 that it be true and one day we will find out that one of us be right and believe it be me if you be right have nothing to worry about because have live great life and will be dead the end but if be right you be in trouble eternity be long time to be wrong

thats not threat just because you take what be type in an angry tone doesn't mean it be threat you also didn't respond to any of my question so be go to make my final argument and leave it at that we obviously differ in opinions and this have get to the point where it be go no where but can tell that you be interest in this type of debate stuff so if you be interest look up the dvd title collision it be debate between the most famous athiest today christopher hitchens and famous presbyterian preacher name douglas wilson think you would find it very interest because it be co-edited by both side of the argument to prevent bias and it would help you see where be come from my last argument be this...to believe something you have to have reason or something which you base this upon base my beliefs on what believe to be the divinely inspire word of god know as the bible that be where get my basis for where morality come from what we have be discuss and all of life's other question this be what base everything have say on my question to you as an athiest be where do you base your beliefs from you have to have something to base what you believe on and as an athiest you cannot do this the only way you can argue what you believe be if you take principals and other things base on intellect from the bible and contort them to what you want to believe the problem with an athiest's belief be that they have no basis to be foundation for what they believe they must take the bible to stand on as base or foundation to argue that it be wrong but then jump back off this foundation when they argue their point you cannot say that morality doesn't come from the bible and then argue it come from combination of human emotions like you do to do this you have to stand on my beliefs bible then jump back off onto what you think be true what foundation do you have to prove that it come from human emotions...nothing you must jump onto the bible to say its wrong then take its principals and change them to fit your belief my point be that to back up what you believe you have to have some origin from which it come from mine be the bible so what be yours my argument against god be that the universe seem so cruel and unjust but how have get this idea of just and unjust man do not call line crook unless he have some idea of straight line what be compare this universe with when call it unjust if the whole show be bad and senseless from to so to speak why do who be suppose to be part of the show find myself in such violent reaction against it of course could have give up my idea of justice by say it be nothing but private idea of my own but if do that then my argument against god collapse too--for the argument depend on say the world be really unjust not simply that it do not happen to please my fancy thus in the very act of try to prove that god do not exist in other word that the whole of reality be senseless find be force to assume that one part of reality namely my idea of justice be full of sense if the whole universe have no mean we should never have find out that it have no mean just as if there be no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eye we should never have know it be dark dark would be without mean c.s. lewis

whats wrong with vibrams
try one size up
hence til about toxoplasmosis gondii
it shouldn't be too hard to implement system that check daily if ads be load for user if they load for the majority of give month give the user trophy
have pair of vibram kso and don't have problems i'd suggest ease yourself into run with them though start with half mile day as it's nothing like run with normal shoe

can tell you take computer science 101 bro you seem pretty legit bet you can code some sweet shit in html i'd gladly take your offer but unfortunately the clusterfuck of exams and project have on my hand aren't go to hold off so can delve into reddit's source code
that's brilliant idea actually if each subreddit could make list of keywords associate with them reddit could be smarter in display ads
from what can tell reddit just display ads randomly is there any way it pick
it's not personally think they should be little more aggressive sure people may get pissy but they won't leave
troubleondemand have pretty good idea http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gjb1t/a_suggestion_to_help_reddits_revenue_stream/c1nyird to filter ads
you seem to dumb and arrogant to reason with so sure i'm wimping out if that will shut you up
that be true but the majority of users hopefully will figure it's not worth the trouble to do so it's not like it's monetary reward so if few people game the system to get trophy it's not too bad if it will make more users remove adblock
yes do do you know anything about program
gt no don't know anything about program amp 3232 _&amp 3232 gt do know that request to check everyone's status on adblock on daily basis be huge waste of time and resources another line or so of code isnt go to do anything to the servers gt what be the incentive for me not to use adblock nothing because you're troll/12 year old but for those of us who be little more relax trophy would be simple incentive tl dr stop send me solicitations for sex to my inbox
but my internet reputation be at stake
why not just check daily or on login then again it's not perfect system just suggestion
gt also charge month subscription to be able to comment and post i'd rather have popups than limit functionality
exactly so users could add reddit to that list and get reward for do so
be think that too actually after submit it good to know that others like it

it's only more days until yak shaving day but in all honesty really wish know don't know about you but i'm 23 year old who grow up w/ren and stimpy and both blame them and thank them for make me as weird and awesome as be these days
as far as can guess yak shaving day be probably the same thing as yaksmas and after watch the episode scooter for yaksmas it's obvious yaksmas be their take on christmas so presumably the same date as christmas however would like to hope however that yak shaving day be its own holiday so look up the original air date of the episode where they say only more days until yak shave day and it be august 25 1991 so we can either assume its always on the same date make it august 30 th every year or it could be holiday like thanksgiving that rotate so since it fell on the last friday of the month we could assume its suppose to fall on the last friday of august every year so because there be no clear cut date ever declare by the show my take on all the evidence tell me to use the date they air the show and the consistency of the christmas date to believe august 30 th be yak shaving day and will celebrate accordingly and maybe on kilted yak eve will catch glimpse of the shave yak on his enchant canoe

wish could upvote this more when first start train start out at flight school they have super nice brand new g1000 cessna 172 and bunch of instructors so that you could theoretically fly anytime it be also very expensive with high hourly rat for the equipment and for instructors and many of the instructors be young and freshly mint cfi's themselves who where just do instruction as way to rack up hours to get into the airlines the turnover rate be high it seem as though every time find someone develop rapport with he head off to another train job or to regional airline end up have to take months off for medical reason surgery when go back to fly do little research and find that the fbo at one of the outlying field about 20 minutes from my house be rent plan for nearly half what the flight school want sure they be much older and well love but they have an engine and two wing and would get you off the grind just as well besides as student pilot you need to be concentrate on how to fly the airplane you can learn the fancy electronics later the fbo also have contact info for couple of local flight instructors one be retire pilot who instruct for fun pretty much just to get out of the house the other be realtor who do it on the side to pay for his daughter's college guys that be more interest in me as student pilot and not as warm body in the leave seat while they rack up hours and as bonus both also charge about half what be pay for instruction at the school so yeah if you're just after your private call around to local fbos and ask if they do flight train or have contact info for cfis they can usually put you in contact with couple in my admittedly limit experience have get much better and cheaper instruction from independent cfis than do at the flight school

well traditionally you don't even use wire most sugar flower make at bakeries or wherever be assemble without wire so the gumpaste need to be little wetter correct if use wire the wire end should be bite fatter that will make it easier and make it look nicer that's good that you keep it moist it usually feel bite dry to good ways to keep it moist be just keep in wrap up very tight in saran wrap or cover it in moist paper towel while work with it if it look little snaggy it probably be too dry you can moisten it with some water on your hand and just knead the gumpaste that will help for beginners make sugar flower i'd say it's 10 time easier if you use fondant it's alot more pliable and easier to work with good luck

we're talk specifically here about republican politicians though personally feel most democrats be just as bad think lot of people like to view corporations as these big bad evil entities because it give them someone to blame for the world's problems the fact of the matter be that corporations allow large group of individuals to pool their resources together and engage in venture that would otherwise be impossible for individuals this include the mass production of computers cars etc that corporation can provide cheaply enough for most members of the public to own one it sound like you're maybe finish up your mba and still have rosy cheek of course corporations can accomplish amaze things so can tank personally don't think they're evil just amoral as for people get angry about corporations do evil things they have every justification to be piss from monsanto push genetically-engineered one season and die corn and sue little farmers to at&amp sue towns and cities who try to deploy their own broadband while fail to invest in next-generation infrastructure it's little more complex than corporations can do good things and people unfairly blame corporations for be evil as scapegoat sometimes those be true things very often they be not when some of these corporations gain regulatory capture and create uncompetitive environments where politicians exist simply to protect their legacy market quite often very bad things happen

it be never break
why aren't bert and earnie black
agreed same here
the paragraph doesn't suggest this be strange it simply highlight how one part of at&amp be claim they need to spend 39 billion on t-mobile in order to reach 97 of the country with lte while at the same time internally calculate that this goal would really only cost 3.8 billion without have t-mobile assets the fact they need the whole purpose to achieve 97 coverage have be their largest talk point during this whole thing
coverage doesn't equal bandwidth this deal isn't about bandwidth it's about reduce competition at&amp already dominate the special access market have huge national backbone and have vastly better coverage and backhaul capabilities than t-mobile t-mobile mostly replicate at&amp gear in urban market and doesn't match at&amp t's coverage in rural market which be already poor the deal isn't about any meaningful network growth at&amp get lot more than coverage from t-mobile they get bunch of gear they'll dismantle chunk of additional spectrum they'll squat on and bunch of redundant employees that they'll fire and store they'll close during recession then they'll come after your wallet eliminate promise grandfathered deal and jack up price courtesy of the 80 market dominance they'll enjoy with verizon by and large the deal be about make sure sprint didn't get t-mobile the article also point out pretty clearly that the number one at&amp talk point be total nonsense not sure how use history of at&amp tactics to suggest at&amp be full of shit be ignorant or how highlight that at&amp t's number be manufacture be bias but ok 95 of press coverage of this deal doesn't bother to question at&amp t's number whatsoever
but people can tell you what they be do that cause the system to fail because they approach them particularly women as they would other human be they be use the same subconscious social mechanisms
50 cents have no idea what the fuck be go on
find the fact this be update and expand instead of be new counterstrike odd and maybe annoy depends on the quality why not make new counterstrike

no there really be letter broadband reports get it wireless week quote from it it be only online for about four hours at&amp confirm to wireless week the letter exist then proceed to insist it contain no real news when it in reality as broadband report note highlight the fact their biggest merger talk point wasn't true outlets may just not be post it because at&amp have lot of angry lawyers...they should post it to wikileaks though
yeah dunno if at&amp be evil but they be incredibly incredibly incredibly full of shit
how can there have ever be any question that this be primarily to reduce competition it's the u.s. we're still debate whether animals evolve
at&amp t's be claim they need to buy t-mobile for 39 billion to move from 80 97 lte coverage but their own lawyer this week leak doc say they could do it for 3.8 billion highlight the fact they're buy t-mobile largely to eliminate them from the market and weaken sprint
wireless week also snag copy quote from it get at&amp to lie that there be nothing new in it though wireless week miss the fact that this 3.8 billion estimate predict in january before the merger be announce shoot at&amp t's primary argument in the foot and the outlet seem to give at&amp the benefit of the doubt few time throughout http://www.wirelessweek.com/news/2011/08/unredacted-att-filing-shows-high-price-tag
from my understand there's nothing in the letter the fcc wasn't already tell in meetings....and this letter be send to the fcc....so the fcc should be well aware that at&amp isn't be entirely honest
at&amp acknowledge the letter exist to wireless week they just pretend it contain nothing new
broadband reports have be around for more than ten years and isn't really obscure wireless week's report be here http://www.wirelessweek.com/news/2011/08/unredacted-att-filing-shows-high-price-tag in it at&amp acknowledge the letter but insist the confidential information in the latest letter be fully consistent with at&amp prior file which isn't true both outlets nab copy of the letter before it be pull offline

actually the sl550 isn't as sporty as hop it would be it's more of luxury tourer
the goofy flop sound my bare feet make on the pavement things that make me move suddenly car or kid on bike pull out from nowhere etc and thus step on rock and thus whoever it be that pull out and cause it look back and me go ouch and shake their head like that's why you don't run barefoot intersections and the end of driveways which for whatever reason always seem to be full of sharp little rock
eh don't know think it's definitely louder than when wear shoe but have no pain and i'm up to about 3.5 miles every other day so if i'm do it wrong i'm not sure how
i'm the opposite think it's annoy when people who aren't run barefoot say they're run barefoot you're either wear shoe or you're not
same except i've be watch it since be bear guess and i'm 20
yeah it have lot of plastic part in the interior for 100 car the s550's interior be lot better look even the new class one be too
it's nicer than the sl550 that's for sure

lol little kid can be brutally honest which be why trust them more than my own friends you deserve that for all that troll especially if it isn't your own kid or family member
no biggie still do most of my run in shoe because i'm not up for serious miles barefoot yet i'll often do two or three barefoot then do another three in shoe or something don't mean to sound snobby just think it's different when there's something between me and the pavement than when there's not just imagine be at party or something with guy and him be like run barefoot too and then compare the bottom of our feet and see that actually he run in vibrams don't know what the bottom of minimalist runners feet look like but mine be permanently black and leathery
may be over exaggerate how loud it be but try land bunch of different ways last night and each way still make noise just like flap sound even though that's not how i'm land can be silent while run in place like on some of these videos but as soon as move forward i'm no longer ninja
