all that report did is agree with what said exxon doesn't pay income tax in the us that article was also written after asking an exxonmobil spokesperson who would never come out and admit their loopholes
if they raised costs too much that would screw them over as that would be the perfect opportunity for competitors to take their business
look at redli0nswift's comment http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/g55vg/iama_member_of_congress_rep_john_garamendi_back/c1kzpur
what i'm saying is that exxon doesn't pay the us the full amount of income/federal taxes that they should your articles say that exxon pays sales taxes i'm not specifically calling out exxon i'm trying to say that there are tax loopholes in the us and it's costing us money
you'd be surprised people easily get swayed by the talking point that this is just about being fair

sorry it has taken me so long to reply have been extremely busy lately and still am so this reply wont be very long am just going to try and give you little bit more to help you understand where am coming from in your first argument about all other human emotions that god created yes he did create all human emotions my question to you is why would he not have created morality as well if he made all of the other emotions it wouldn't be logical to not create morality along with all of these emotions and your point was could these things combine to create morality well if all of these emotions were created by god and put together through human action wouldn't that mean that god ultimately created morality think so also regarding your argument about morality and dna relating not to be rude but you sound like complete moron trying to compare things that don't relate whatsoever adam and eve also had dna just because they were not born doesn't mean that they didn't necesarily have dna you have not made an argument yet regarding your comment why an athiest or thiest should believe me that is not my job to do my job as christian is to share the gospel with those around me and what believe cant make you accept what believe only god can so it is not my job as christian to make you believe this but only merely to spread the gospel the bible makes this perfectly clear just because adam and eve at from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil doesnt mean that did not understand not to eat from it you are making no point or argument again you dont have to eat from tree to understand the morality and law that god had laid in front of adam and eve he told them not to eat from it so they were not supposed to eat of it this is the only knowledge they needed to obey god they understood what they were doing my question to you is if they didnt know what they were doing why did satan tempt them if they didnt know not to eat from it they would have eventually eaten from it without any need of his temptation this is an argument regarding the fact that even though am christian still sin you are clearly misinformed and misunderstand christianity no where in the bible does it say that will never sin again just because am christian the bible does make it clear that will have new desires for god and righteousness which do and new hatred of sin which do the bible actually says that will suffer as christian even more so than none believer why do you think jesus said foxes and birds of the air have homes but the son of man has nowhere to stay he promised his followers that they would struggle and suffer in sin and temptation but this is not their final home heaven is the completion of christs work on the cross to finally bring his followers into new bodies where they will no longer sin so yes someone could ultimately as you say slip up and cheat on their wife as christian but their life will be marked by repentance and produce good fruit overall if they continue in this sin then it is merely evidence that they were never saved and they never repented to follow christ saying god is an hole also want you to see...you are not making an argument you are simply making fool of yourself by spouting off to understand calvinism and the will of god am going to give you link to great christian resource website of preacher named john piper he can say it much clearer than ever could this is an article on the two wills of god and how he could appoint hitler yet still convict him for what he did and use it for good this regards more of salvation and election but this also works for how god could appoint hitler and still convict him of his sin it works in both cases also am giving you link to the proper doctrinal name for what believe answers these questions about christianity and the bible and that is compatibilism am not trying to sway you to believe in compatibilism but merely show you what mean and believe http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/articles/are-there-two-wills-in-god http://barrywallace.wordpress.com/2008/11/11/da-carson-and-ch-spurgeon-on-compatibilism yeah actually think it should impress you because can bet that you haven't memorized anything that substantial in content or length and also to inform you do understand it that is why chose to memorize that particular book have also made plenty of arguments that just because you dont believe them doesnt mean its not an argument regarding your last sentence how you think it is all crazy what believe...i will say you are right it does sound crazy but have faith hebrews 11:1 that it is true and one day we will find out that one of us was right and believe it was me if you are right have nothing to worry about because have lived great life and will be dead the end but if am right you are in trouble eternity is long time to be wrong

thats not threat just because you took what was typing in an angry tone doesn't mean it was threat you also didn't respond to any of my questions so am going to make my final argument and leave it at that we obviously differ in opinions and this has gotten to the point where it is going no where but can tell that you are interested in this type of debate stuff so if you are interested look up the dvd titled collision it is debate between the most famous athiest today christopher hitchens and famous presbyterian preacher named douglas wilson think you would find it very interesting because it was co-edited by both sides of the argument to prevent bias and it would help you see where am coming from my last argument is this...to believe something you have to have reason or something which you base this upon base my beliefs on what believe to be the divinely inspired word of god known as the bible that is where get my basis for where morality comes from what we have been discussing and all of life's other questions this is what base everything have said on my question to you as an athiest is where do you base your beliefs from you have to have something to base what you believe on and as an athiest you cannot do this the only way you can argue what you believe is if you take principals and other things based on intellect from the bible and contort them to what you want to believe the problem with an athiest's belief is that they have no basis to be foundation for what they believe they must take the bible to stand on as base or foundation to argue that it is wrong but then jump back off this foundation when they argue their point you cannot say that morality doesn't come from the bible and then argue it comes from combination of human emotions like you did to do this you had to stand on my beliefs bible then jump back off onto what you think is true what foundation do you have to prove that it comes from human emotions...nothing you must jump onto the bible to say its wrong then take its principals and change them to fit your belief my point is that to back up what you believe you have to have some origin from which it comes from mine is the bible so what is yours my argument against god was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust but how had got this idea of just and unjust man does not call line crooked unless he has some idea of straight line what was comparing this universe with when called it unjust if the whole show was bad and senseless from to so to speak why did who was supposed to be part of the show find myself in such violent reaction against it of course could have given up my idea of justice by saying it was nothing but private idea of my own but if did that then my argument against god collapsed too--for the argument depended on saying the world was really unjust not simply that it did not happen to please my fancies thus in the very act of trying to prove that god did not exist in other words that the whole of reality was senseless found was forced to assume that one part of reality namely my idea of justice was full of sense if the whole universe has no meaning we should never have found out that it has no meaning just as if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes we should never have known it was dark dark would be without meaning c.s. lewis

whats wrong with vibrams
try one size up
hence til about toxoplasmosis gondii
it shouldn't be too hard to implement system that checks daily if ads are loading for user if they load for the majority of given month give the user trophy
have pair of vibram kso and don't have problems i'd suggest easing yourself into running with them though start with half mile day as it's nothing like running with normal shoes

check if adblock is enabled by checking the visibility of the ad or pixel set on the page that will trigger filter if it's not enabled send command with the user id to update database keeping track of days that adblock has been disabled when the value in the database hits certain value award trophy edit and yes if need be i'll do it and no it's not three liner but all that needs to be added is something to check adblocks status i'm fairly sure
have any way to back that up or are you just lookin to start an internet tough guy fight i'm pretty sure my e-peen is bigger than yours

can tell you took computer science 101 bro you seem pretty legit bet you can code some sweet shit in html i'd gladly take your offer but unfortunately the clusterfuck of exams and projects have on my hands aren't going to hold off so can delve into reddit's source code
that's brilliant idea actually if each subreddit could make list of keywords associated with them reddit could be smarter in displaying ads
from what can tell reddit just displays ads randomly is there any way it picks
it's not personally think they should be little more aggressive sure people may get pissy but they won't leave
troubleondemand has pretty good idea http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gjb1t/a_suggestion_to_help_reddits_revenue_stream/c1nyird to filter ads
you seem to dumb and arrogant to reason with so sure i'm wimping out if that will shut you up
that is true but the majority of users hopefully will figure it's not worth the trouble to do so it's not like it's monetary reward so if few people game the system to get trophy it's not too bad if it will make more users remove adblock
yes do do you know anything about programming
gt no don't know anything about programming amp 3232 _&amp 3232 gt do know that requesting to check everyone's status on adblock on daily basis is huge waste of time and resources another line or so of code isnt going to do anything to the servers gt what is the incentive for me not to use adblock nothing because you're troll/12 year old but for those of us who are little more relaxed trophy would be simple incentive tl dr stop sending me solicitations for sex to my inbox
but my internet reputation is at stake
why not just check daily or on login then again it's not perfect system just suggestion
gt also charge month subscription to be able to comment and post i'd rather have popups than limited functionality
exactly so users could add reddit to that list and get rewarded for doing so
was thinking that too actually after submitted it good to know that others like it

it's only more days until yak shaving day but in all honesty really wish knew don't know about you but i'm 23 year old who grew up w/ren and stimpy and both blame them and thank them for making me as weird and awesome as am these days
as far as can guess yak shaving day is probably the same thing as yaksmas and after watching the episode scooter for yaksmas it's obvious yaksmas is their take on christmas so presumably the same date as christmas however would like to hope however that yak shaving day is its own holiday so looked up the original airing date of the episode where they say only more days until yak shaving day and it is august 25 1991 so we can either assume its always on the same date making it august 30 th every year or it could be holiday like thanksgiving that rotates so since it fell on the last friday of the month we could assume its supposed to fall on the last friday of august every year so because there is no clear cut date ever declared by the show my take on all the evidence tells me to use the date they aired the show and the consistency of the christmas date to believe august 30 th is yak shaving day and will celebrate accordingly and maybe on kilted yak eve will catch glimpse of the shaven yak on his enchanted canoe

after few week delay between the oral and practical portion of my checkride got my flying portion done last friday last night was able to take my lovely wife on her first trip in small plane to get 100 pizza and she loved it don't have my logbook near me so don't have all the stats but was at 44.2 hours when took the checkride next step is going to be joining local flying club so have cheaper access to better planes than the one i've been renting and starting work on my instrument ticket
well the plane rented got at great rate 1971 cessna 150 for 70 hour wet if anyone near st paul minnesota is interested in learning highly recommend http://www.amrosaviation.com at 44.2 hours 3320 after tax for the plane think had about 25 hours dual and the instructor was 40 hour so add another 1000 so 4300 for plane and instructor other costs 300 for the examiner for my checkride 150 for the medical exam it's been while so this is an estimate 900 for my lightspeed zulu headset could have gone lot cheaper but knew i'd be in this for the long haul 130 for my flightbag not needed but love my bag 200 various charts books logbooks e6b foggles ect originally budgeted for 6000 and figure i'm pretty close could have probably saved 1000 if went cheaper on my headset and just used regular backpack as for time started my training early november and finished my checkride at the end of april in between there was the worst winter for flying anyone up here remembers crisis at work that meant no flying for about weeks the plane being grounded for week and other scheduling conflicts with examiners cfis and other students
yup watched the video they have on their webpage and was sold
it means the rental price includes all fuel used
i've never heard it put that way but that is right on if you look at it that way i've been having fun flying paying for it as go then 44.2 hours later they gave me certificate
yup i'm getting some of the cross country time that the ir requires in the books now i'm also going to start the ground school in the next few weeks and after that i'll probably go for the commercial ticket as well

check out the rate of return cal pers has gotten on their investments for the past 30 or 40 years it exceeds overall one reason for the shortage in the fund is that the state of california chose to not make contributions toward the fund during years when pers had exceeded their expected return for those years well now they're short--thanks state of ca

past performance is indeed not indicative of future results pray tell me what rate are you going to base your projections do you have basis for your projections at all pers has been doing this for long long time--have you in addition compensation as percentage of state revenues often exceeds 80 um i'm wondering where you get this little tidbit your saying that what the state did not pay into the retirement fund which they should have was somehow magically bonused to the state employees certainly missed my check strange bookkeeping you do wow you know 80 of what the state didn't give me the last three years magically went into the pockets of rich non-taxpayers can as easily say that

wish could upvote this more when first started training started out at flight school they had super nice brand new g1000 cessna 172 and bunch of instructors so that you could theoretically fly anytime it was also very expensive with high hourly rates for the equipment and for instructors and many of the instructors were young and freshly minted cfi's themselves who where just doing instruction as way to rack up hours to get into the airlines the turnover rate was high it seemed as though every time found someone developed rapport with he headed off to another training job or to regional airline ended up having to take months off for medical reasons surgery when went back to flying did little research and found that the fbo at one of the outlying fields about 20 minutes from my house was renting planes for nearly half what the flight school wanted sure they were much older and well loved but they had an engine and two wings and would get you off the ground just as well besides as student pilot you need to be concentrating on how to fly the airplane you can learn the fancy electronics later the fbo also had contact info for couple of local flight instructors one was retired pilot who instructs for fun pretty much just to get out of the house the other was realtor who does it on the side to pay for his daughter's college guys that were more interested in me as student pilot and not as warm body in the left seat while they racked up hours and as bonus both also charged about half what was paying for instruction at the school so yeah if you're just after your private call around to local fbos and ask if they do flight training or have contact info for cfis they can usually put you in contact with couple in my admittedly limited experience have gotten much better and cheaper instruction from independent cfis than did at the flight school

well faggot read the article to begin with the fact you think this means something just means you know dick prison guards are not allowed to take their vacation as it accrues because the prisons are all understaffed whether there is 80 day limit on vacation or not means nothing it has never been enforced it can't be because the guards weren't allowed to take the vacation so they have to be paid out when they retire this contract doesn't change anything at all the guards and do know some would actually like to be able to take their vacation let me ask you would you rather take your vacation today or get paid for that day off 20 years from now at whatever your future pay rate is fucking idiot

4-5 hours it's so much easier to make them when the gumpaste isn't hard which it would be after even hour the most important thing with making sugar flowers is to work quickly that way instead of having dry petals just next to each other you can make it more realistic and actually form flower good luck on your future sugar flower work
well traditionally you don't even use wires most sugar flowers made at bakeries or wherever are assembled without wires so the gumpaste needs to be little wetter correct if using wires the wire end should be bit fatter that will make it easier and make it look nicer that's good that you kept it moist it usually feels bit dry to good ways to keep it moist are just keep in wrapped up very tight in saran wrap or cover it in moist paper towel while working with it if it looks little snaggy it probably is too dry you can moisten it with some water on your hands and just knead the gumpaste that will help for beginners make sugar flowers i'd say it's 10 times easier if you use fondant it's alot more pliable and easier to work with good luck

bells palsy and partial face paralysis is later stage symptom of human lyme infection...did the vet say dogs could get bells palsy antibiotics should clear that up....i was diagnosed this week with lyme and it's kicking my ass so fee for your pup and you
have lyme disease with no rash or bullseye mark i've read that anywhere from30-50 percent of lyme sufferers don't have rashes as symptom
me love you long time have my babies kkthx
check out r/wicked_edge i'd link but i'm on my phone
check out r/wicked_edge
sorry to hear that reading up on this disease there are so many examples where doctors screwed up their diagnosis and caused more problems than they fixed
dear god thank you for this
id like to point out that this song randomly jumped in my head yesterday what's that about
this absolutely sounds like lyme joint pain or one of the associated tick borne similar diseases and dug bit and dog's can get form of bell's palsy leading to facial paralysis due to lyme as someone who got lyme last week i've only seriously been researching this for little while but one thing learned that was just staggering in volume is how many people with lyme are told they don't have it due to sometimes incorrect blood tests and then the disease goes on to wreck their body assume the same is probably true with dogs

we're talking specifically here about republican politicians though personally feel most democrats are just as bad think lot of people like to view corporations as these big bad evil entities because it gives them someone to blame for the world's problems the fact of the matter is that corporations allow large groups of individuals to pool their resources together and engage in ventures that would otherwise be impossible for individuals this includes the mass production of computers cars etc that corporation can provide cheaply enough for most members of the public to own one it sounds like you're maybe finishing up your mba and still have rosy cheeks of course corporations can accomplish amazing things so can tanks personally don't think they're evil just amoral as for people getting angry about corporations doing evil things they have every justification to be pissed from monsanto pushing genetically-engineered one season and die corn and suing little farmers to at&amp suing towns and cities who try to deploy their own broadband while failing to invest in next-generation infrastructure it's little more complex than corporations can do good things and people unfairly blame corporations for being evil as scapegoat sometimes those are true things very often they are not when some of these corporations gain regulatory capture and create uncompetitive environments where politicians exist simply to protect their legacy markets quite often very bad things happen

how long were you on antibiotics
having just been diagnosed two weeks ago it is an interesting film feel like it does get bit too dramatic since i've now talked to dozens of people who have had lyme and managed to eliminate it with the standard 10-30 day course of doxycycline however for those who were misdiagnosed and had it for years before treatment it really is horrible road finding lot of legitimate sufferers mixed with internet crazies in forums that make getting an accurate read difficult film doesn't help that at least here there are many docs who are smart about lyme my general pract knew what it was immediately

what wrong with england is the welfare state sucking all the wealth out of the country but you will never get member of the liberal bourgeoisie admitting that because they have symbiotic relationship with the political class
were you under the hood or did you get to take it off while you were punching clouds
never got bullseye...so i'm lucky my doctor wasn't an idiot on thirty days of doxycycline really really hoping kill it all the first go round
because that's the president's job make the unreasonable endless war increasingly diminishing infrastructure investment low-quality and expensive health care and government run entirely by the nation's largest and wealthiest corporations seem like fun
really really hope beat it with this initial 30 day course of doxycycline first two weeks really were quite nasty

i'm buried so far down at this point that i'll probably never get upboated but here's my story it's not so much fired as quit over management asshattery my first job while still in high school was working at kroger this all occurred sometime in late 1998 started out as courtesy clerk bagboy but within year was cashier got sick for few days with bronchitis and wasn't able to work called and let them know stayed out of school and all was good in the meantime had missed test in my english class we had also had management turnover at the store few weeks earlier which seemed to happen with disturbing regularity since it was an excused absence was allowed to take the test after school so told the store the day before that would be about 30 minutes late coming in the following day because had to stay late and make up an exam my supervisor who was cool we used to go play laser tag after work sometimes said no problem so was 30 minutes late to work making up an exam at school few days later the store manager calls me and my supervisor upstairs he tells me that have an attendance problem i'm like wtf and my supervisor is like wtf prior to getting sick and needing to make up the exam had never once called in sick or even been minute late my supervisor says i've been model employee and point out that had informed the store more than 24 hours in advance for both times had been out even provided notices from the doctor and my teacher as still had them in my locker didn't matter he was intransigent he was holding time clock record of who all had been on the schedule and not clocked in or had been late that week and according to him every one of those people was an attendance problem regardless of the reason or letting the store know beforehand he told me that could either acknowledge that had problem and accept disciplinary notice or be fired told him in no uncertain terms that would not admit had problem when no such problem existed and that if this was not acceptable to him then resigned effective immediately which then did handed my shirt in and left but the joke was on them when one of my teachers found out had left the store and told her what had happened she had connection at local transit company she knew had been playing with web design on the side and they were looking for someone to help them get website set up and write some applications to help with scheduling two weeks later at 17 had an office with door and window desk and computer and was writing code and made enough money over the next months to buy new car few jobs and college degree later i'm now software engineer at dot-com so yeah quitting that job sucked still miss some of the people worked with but it put me in the right place with the right connections to get my foot in the door for my career

the barely walk the next day is the part i'm worried about don't want to miss my regular runs because did short barefoot one think i'm going to do an easy half-mile barefoot tonight and see how it goes

12 year old can certainly be in full blown puberty and be mistaken for 16 year old to consider them child rapists is inflammatory sounds to me like these dumb-assed girls wanted sex and got it the men obviously made dumb mistake getting roped into this by dumb kids but wouldn't call them child rapists
anatawa utsukushi desu
yeah i'm sure the judges looked at those 12 year olds saw someone pre-pubescent and believed these guys excuse about being mistaken about their ages and let them go you're fucking mental giant
thanks understand that concept it's not really the point point is the rapists in this case had legitimate belief that these girls could have been of legal age and were asking for sex

here's what i've done barefoot so far from memory it may be slightly different but you'll get the idea all has been on the pavement on the street in my subdivision this is in addition to my regular runs in shoes sat 7/16 ran about 0.5 miles sun 7/17 no barefoot mon 7/18 walked about mile tues 7/19 ran about 0.5 miles walked about 0.5 miles weds 7/20 no barefoot can't remember thurs 7/21 ran about 0.5 miles walked about 0.5 miles fri 7/22 no barefoot sat 7/23 no barefoot though spent few hours barefoot on beach if that matters sun 7/24 ran about mile plus some walking mon 7/25 no barefoot tues 7/26 hope to go mile plus some walking but may just go half the mile on sunday shredded some old blisters that had calloused so we'll see how it looks it doesn't hurt just don't want to tear into softer flesh if that makes sense this isn't based on any system really it's just what's felt right for me note that i've been running for 15 or 16 years so have decent base built up newer runners may want to take it even slower than have hope this helps

think little of both i'm an editor by trade so i'm picky about words but the barefoot vs minimalist shoes thing bothers me every time talk to someone about barefoot running it seems like they say yeah just got my new vibram's they're great to me it's just not the same thing
may end up in minimalist shoes soon enough midwest winters are cold and icy and i'm not sure i'm up for pure barefoot running in weather like that

couldn't care less about reposts most of the things find on reddit that enjoy were probably reposts that wouldn't otherwise have seen saw this link online liked it and wanted to share it if person can't handle the occasional repost they shouldn't come to reddit
the lunge for sure
looks nice how do you like it just ordered one i've heard nothing but good things about them so far
it was never broken
why aren't bert and earnie black
agreed same here
the paragraph doesn't suggest this is strange it simply highlights how one part of at&amp is claiming they need to spend 39 billion on t-mobile in order to reach 97 of the country with lte while at the same time internally calculating that this goal would really only cost 3.8 billion without having t-mobile assets the fact they need the whole purpose to achieve 97 coverage has been their largest talking point during this whole thing
coverage doesn't equal bandwidth this deal isn't about bandwidth it's about reducing competition at&amp already dominates the special access market has huge national backbone and has vastly better coverage and backhaul capabilities than t-mobile t-mobile mostly replicates at&amp gear in urban markets and doesn't match at&amp t's coverage in rural markets which is already poor the deal isn't about any meaningful network growth at&amp gets lot more than coverage from t-mobile they get bunch of gear they'll dismantle chunk of additional spectrum they'll squat on and bunch of redundant employees that they'll fire and stores they'll close during recession then they'll come after your wallet eliminating promised grandfathered deals and jacking up prices courtesy of the 80 market dominance they'll enjoy with verizon by and large the deal is about making sure sprint didn't get t-mobile the article also points out pretty clearly that the number one at&amp talking point is total nonsense not sure how using history of at&amp tactics to suggest at&amp is full of shit is ignorant or how highlighting that at&amp t's numbers are manufactured is biased but ok 95 of press coverage of this deal doesn't bother to question at&amp t's numbers whatsoever
but people can tell you what they were doing that caused the system to fail because they approach them particularly women as they would other human beings they are using the same subconscious social mechanisms
50 cents has no idea what the fuck is going on
find the fact this is updated and expanded instead of being new counterstrike odd and maybe annoying depends on the quality why not make new counterstrike

no there really was letter broadband reports got it wireless week quoted from it it was only online for about four hours at&amp confirmed to wireless week the letter existed then proceeded to insist it contained no real news when it in reality as broadband reports notes highlighted the fact their biggest merger talking point wasn't true outlets may just not be posting it because at&amp has lots of angry lawyers...they should post it to wikileaks though
yeah dunno if at&amp is evil but they are incredibly incredibly incredibly full of shit
how can there have ever been any question that this is primarily to reduce competition it's the u.s. we're still debating whether animals evolve
at&amp t's been claiming they need to buy t-mobile for 39 billion to move from 80 97 lte coverage but their own lawyer this week leaked doc saying they could do it for 3.8 billion highlighting the fact they're buying t-mobile largely to eliminate them from the market and weaken sprint
wireless week also snagged copy quoted from it got at&amp to lie that there was nothing new in it though wireless week misses the fact that this 3.8 billion estimate predicted in january before the merger was announced shoots at&amp t's primary argument in the foot and the outlet seems to give at&amp the benefit of the doubt few times throughout http://www.wirelessweek.com/news/2011/08/unredacted-att-filing-shows-high-price-tag
from my understanding there's nothing in the letter the fcc wasn't already told in meetings....and this letter was sent to the fcc....so the fcc should be well aware that at&amp isn't being entirely honest
at&amp acknowledges the letter exists to wireless week they just pretend it contained nothing new
broadband reports has been around for more than ten years and isn't really obscure wireless week's report is here http://www.wirelessweek.com/news/2011/08/unredacted-att-filing-shows-high-price-tag in it at&amp acknowledges the letter but insists the confidential information in the latest letter is fully consistent with at&amp prior filings which isn't true both outlets nabbed copy of the letter before it was pulled offline

i'd definitely avoid striking with the heel when go barefoot i've found run lot lower as in my knees stay bent much more but also taller as in my torso posture is straighter think landing flat is the way go though it may sound counter-intuitive know don't strike forefoot
hate that that's the one thing hadn't anticipated being an issue when started going barefoot

for the record was an ardent obama supporter and voted for him last election the william broyles article linked above puts into words the exact feelings and believe many other former obama supporters have regretting our decisions that have allowed obama to compromise this country into third consecutive term for the republicans
wish could agree with this his right track seems to be letting the republicans have pretty much whatever they want he needs to take stand already
brilliant parenting done right
really is this how people like to proceed with intelligent dialogue
it was somewhere around there alignment was actually quite easy set everything up at my house to make sure all the configurations were good then brought one endpoint to my friends house and bolted it to the roof eyeballed it and it connected after the initial connection had laptop on the roof with me and the bullet's management webpage has signal meter on it used that to fine tune
not even that complicated the bullets can be set in access point mode or client mode they do no routing here is the full setup at my friend's house the internet connection comes into the comcast cable modem obviously the cable modem is connected to the wan port of linksys router network cable runs from standard lan port on the linksys router to poe injector which runs up to the bullet on the roof the bullets are weather proof the bullet has static lan ip address and is set to bridge network mode and set as base station access point the bullet has an antenna connector that screws directly into the antenna linked to earlier my house again bullet is screwed directly into the antenna then to the poe etc the bullet is configured again with static lan ip address the poe then plugs into switch the switch feeds all my devices and an access point or two use the router at my friend's house as my default gateway and pull dns dhcp right across the wifi bridge it's all one big flat network if didn't trust my friend could also treat the bullet at my house as my isp and plug it into router/firewall screen http://i.imgur.com/5zdgq.jpg

istockphoto costs money plus it's stock which is ok sometimes but usually pretty bland i'm looking into using google's advanced search for images labeled reusable but i'm little hesitant to use images unless can be 100 sure they're usable it can be costly to use an image without permission if you get caught thanks
thanks that's one option but man the quality of photos on these stock sites sure makes me appreciate professional photographers

you would notice no difference on your end google apps email still provides you with custom email address so it's still duke.edu and it's separate from your gmail the only difference is it won't suck and it won't have shitty ui
when did users lose email did miss something
gt forward my stuff to gmail anyway except when duke's servers get registered as spam by google and then it stops forwarding until oit does something it's happened few times
contact oit they're fairly reasonable folks

also there was function earlier to let your log in with netid and it would pull up your courses for you but duke doesn't like competition and they made me pull the feature...for now
in the process of it actually it should at least cover some server costs so don't lose money but i'd rather focus on helping students and then look on how to turn profit

actually the sl550 isn't as sporty as hoped it would be it's more of luxury tourer
the goofy flopping sound my bare feet make on the pavement things that make me move suddenly car or kid on bike pulls out from nowhere etc and thus step on rocks and thus whoever it was that pulled out and caused it looks back and me going ouch and shakes their head like that's why you don't run barefoot intersections and the ends of driveways which for whatever reason always seem to be full of sharp little rocks
eh don't know think it's definitely louder than when wear shoes but have no pain and i'm up to about 3.5 miles every other day so if i'm doing it wrong i'm not sure how
i'm the opposite think it's annoying when people who aren't running barefoot say they're running barefoot you're either wearing shoes or you're not
same except i've been watching it since was born guess and i'm 20
yeah it has lot of plastic parts in the interior for 100 car the s550's interior is lot better looking even the new class one is too
it's nicer than the sl550 that's for sure
here's qr code threw together http://imgur.com/g47lj

why didn't you apply sooner classes start this monday
lol little kids can be brutally honest which is why trust them more than my own friends you deserved that for all that trolling especially if it isn't your own kid or family member
no biggie still do most of my running in shoes because i'm not up for serious miles barefoot yet i'll often do two or three barefoot then do another three in shoes or something don't mean to sound snobby just think it's different when there's something between me and the pavement than when there's not just imagine being at party or something with guy and him being like run barefoot too and then comparing the bottoms of our feet and seeing that actually he runs in vibrams don't know what the bottom of minimalist runners feet look like but mine are permanently black and leathery
may be over exaggerating how loud it is but tried landing bunch of different ways last night and each way still made noise just like flapping sound even though that's not how i'm landing can be silent while running in place like on some of these videos but as soon as move forward i'm no longer ninja

no because they burned the body if it was the flesh when the flesh doctor was killed at the lake it would've turned back into it's original flesh form
